"Subject: as promised molly  sorry about the mix - up on the email molly .  i hope you get this one .  as most good corporations like enron have predefined contractual arrangements  to do executive search business i will be happy to abide by your terms and  rules .  and to be quite honest - enron is about the "" best it gets "" so , i prefer to not  draft a contract this time or for this relationship - i will wait for yours to  be signed by me . the only stipulation i request of you is that upon  contractual performance , enron accounts payable please wire my funds to my  account as i have a multi - currency account denominated in usd / canadian or  british pounds ( which ever fits you as i may need to pay my counterparts in  the uk ) . . . other than that i have no perplexities .  i will send you my wire instructions later , either my bank in california or  in bermuda .  as i live in california and do contingency search , i must go off of my  client ' s "" good word "" on occasion and luckily haven ' t had any problems so  far . . . i always honor california verbal contract law - if i do not draft .  i think you fee payment of 20 % is generous and the industry standard of 30  day guarantee on replacement is fair . obviously there is no deposit on any  contingency and if there is a definite urgent need for a position to be  filled only then will i ask your help for a minor deposit to aid in my  overhead to shift all my resources to search on behalf on enron .  as enron has the in -

what i have done for the lng transactions .  1 . i was not involved in the lng ship project . i shall read the dash  and give you my comments . without looking at the details , i think that the  decision  to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island  project ( please , see point 2 ) .  2 . elba island . i am working with doug rotenberbg , brad hitch , scott earnest  ( sally beck ' s organization ) and rac to set up the book for the elba island  transaction . the next step  will be to expand the book to capture all the enron ' s lng - related positions  in one place and  to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges . a working group is  meeting to close a few  remaining gaps tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 8 : 30 .  a few comments on the book design and my view of the project :  a . the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island  facility  by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis . marginal cargos will represent  supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long - term  contracts or became available due to some short - term frictions .  the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long - term  contract prices . the economics of the deal , as represented by the book we are  setting up , will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos  but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis , arranging shipping and  coordinating  the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us . in other words ,  we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction .  b . the transaction will cover the period of 17 years ( with an extension  option of  5 years ) . even if we can lock - in the lng volumes over this time period , we  have no ability to lock - in the other side of the spread ( us gas prices ) for  such a long tenor . this is  essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng - nat gas spread  and  i would not recommend locking - in only one leg of the spread .  one solution would be to cover , let ' s say , 50 % of he lng volumes for the  first  5 years and lock - in the nat gas side on the us market side .  c . the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions  regarding sources of lng , shipping rates , schedules , etc . i would set up a  big prudence reserve  in case we mark it to market .  d . my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island  deal  ( that are good for enron ) and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions .  long - term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail  that  correlates very well with brent .  vince  john sherriff  05 / 14 / 2000 01 : 40 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @

"Subject: industry giants can ' t match this opportunity  another ground breaking news alert from rlyc .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  one company is quickly entering a $ 2 trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi - national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching . in just a few months , this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long - term customers that could generate tremendous re - occurring revenues for many years to come .  although you have probably never heard of this company , you may soon hear of it even if you don ' t continue reading this message . that ' s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u . s . within the next year .  an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry  in reality , this company ' s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you . since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don ' t know this company or what they plan to accomplish , their stock is trading at rock bottom prices . but , if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years , this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments .  the company that we ' ll introduce you to today is ( relay capital corp . pink sheets : rlyc ) . rlyc , which recently went public , is a multi - faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market . rlyc ' s present product and service offerings include pre - paid stored - value cards , reward cards , employee payroll cards , gift , retail and affinity group cards , travel cards and funds transfer cards . these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally .  just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn ' t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner . in order to be successful , that company also needs to be truly innovative , have very strong partners , be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality . rlyc appears to be that company .  below we ' ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  stored - value cards have the potential to help the 50 million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e - commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities . the implications reverberate across industry segments . estimates suggest stored - value transactions could exceed $ 2 trillion in just a few years .  rlyc ' s focus is on providing stored - value cards to the un - banked and under - banked . these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account , debit card . the size of that group is staggering that ' s about one - third of the nation ' s work force !  rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored - value card programs that make it easy , fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored - value cards as well as for the un - banked and under - banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards .  but that ' s not all . the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships . in this segment , relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer . who wouldn ' t want that ? the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc  for the under - and un - banked , collecting their pay , cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming . rlyc ' s stored - value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem .  rlyc ' s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un - banked alike ! lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u . s . cards , cards in foreign countries , and services bought through the cards , improved employee retention , improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc . various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system , while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or 24 hour access to their money through atms .  rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards  earlier this year , rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc ( click to go to their site ) , a leader in providing technical , craft and administrative staffing services to businesses , industry and government through locations in houston , dallas , long island , orlando , phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un - and under - banked populations .  the potential market for this service is really big . it includes large employers , companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers .  this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing , cutting , and mailing paper payroll checks . it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay , eliminate lost checks , stop payments and minimize fraud . but best of all , this should help to significantly boost rlyc ' s revenues .  $ 150 billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries  mexicans in u . s . send $ 16 . 3 billion a year back to mexico  with $ 150 billion being transferred internationally each year , remittances are a really big business . in times past , people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices . many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union . more recently , more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances .  the problems with traditional money transfer methods  with wire services , there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas . first , wiring funds across borders can be expensive . this can make it very cost - prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service . next there is the problem of logistics . both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company ' s services . even if they both are able to do this , the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them . lastly , the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose . these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives . so , even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money , it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use .  with money orders there is always the problem of mail service . although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service , this is not always the case in foreign countries . this is especially true in underdeveloped nations , where most remittances are sent . a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive . and , there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all , meaning that the sender ' s family could go hungry or end up on the streets .  what is the best way to send remittances ?  by far the most convenient , fast , safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored - value card . with this type of service , a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account ( onto the card ) via loading station , telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country .  the process is extremely easy and cost - effective . funds can be added to the card ' s account at an ever increasing number of convenient locations . the family member overseas can then draw down on those funds by presenting a card from that account to make purchases or they can use the card to withdraw cash from atms . it could not be any simpler .  rlyc has already begun filling orders  in june of this year , rlyc announced that it had received its first order for 2 , 000 pin - based stored value cards . the company stated that its growth estimates call for approximately 2 , 000 new stored - value cards being put into circulation each month . this could result in exponential revenue growth as new customers are added and its customers take advantage of its other financial services . moreover , though other programs it is working on , it could have one half million cards in the market within the next 18 months .  rlyc plans to expand its services through partner companies and one - stop financial centers  rlyc expects to fuel exponential growth of recurring revenue from individual card usage , monthly fees , as well as other activities occurring at its loading centers or the virtual financial centers it is planning . loading centers are retail locations , such as convenience stores , check cashing facilities or other types of retail facilities serving to dispense or receive cash facilitating transactions for the debit card consumer . rlyc has already established strategic relationships with leading card processors , vendors and distributors , and is in program development with key partners that may bring over 100 , 000 retail locations and a host of great opportunities to dramatically increase its brand recognition .  rlyc plans a host of new financial products and service offerings  some of the products and services rlyc plans to be launching in the coming months include commercial , auto and sba loans , mortgages , all types of affinity group ( loyalty / rewards ) cards , pharmacy discount cards , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health savings accounts and health and life insurance . rylc is expanding extremely rapidly and at this pace , should gain a whole lot of exposure to the investment community f - a - s - t ! ! !  rlyc plans to grow through joint ventures and acquisitions  through a well - planned strategy to partner with major players in the financial services industry and through key acquisitions of complimentary companies , rlyc plans to fuel its growth . it has begun identifying and will negotiate business joint ventures , acquisitions and partnerships within the stored value card industry .  rlyc is positioned to offer expanded payroll products as well as define a niche market for its private label stored value solutions . with corporate network ' s assistance , it expects to add new and expansive products linked to its card platform and provide its customers with a growing range of superior products and increased customer loyalty .  rlyc plans to enter the emerging high growth health savings account ( hsa ) market  rlyc has entered into an agreement in principle with mydaily corp . , an employee benefit and financial services company , to provide health saving account ( hsa ) stored value debit cards that will enable employees to easily pay routine medical bills with pre - tax dollars .  health savings accounts ( hsa ) are tax - sheltered savings accounts similar to an ira , but earmarked for medical expenses and are part of a high deductible insurance plan . deposits are 100 % tax - deductible for the self - employed and for employees of companies that offer an hsa .  this could be an enormous new market for rlyc  it is estimated that all millions of non - elderly americans will soon have access to a health savings account , creating a market of unprecedented potential . in fact , due to the rising costs of employer - sponsored health plans , it is also estimated that one in every two major employers in the united states is considering consumer directed health plans and hsa for their employees .  experienced stored value card and financial services industry executive named ceo of relay capital corp .  e . reese bogle iii , experienced financial services and stored value card industry executive , has been named relay ' s . most recently he was one of the founders , and served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of interstate net bank ( www . isnbank . com ) , establishing it as a visa principal member .  prior to this , mr . bogle , was vp of e * trade bank ' s corporate development and strategic alliances group and president of telebanc insurance services , inc . he also served as vp and marketing director of premium bank , and held a variety of managerial and marketing positions at leading financial services companies .  relay will be adding real depth experience to its management team  the next step is to bring a well qualified management team to relay capital said mr . bogle . once the team is onboard , we intend to build relay capital into a diversified financial services provider that , in addition to looking for exponential growth of recurring revenue generated from individual stored card usage , as well as other financial service activities occurring at our card loading centers or its virtual financial centers , we potentially plan to provide : commercial loans , auto loans , sba loans , mortgages , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health benefits ( dental , vision ) , life insurance benefits , pharmacy drug discounts , loyalty and reward programs , and shopping discount programs .  with innovative products and services targeted to trillion dollar market ; a host of powerful partners ; key acquisitions in the works ; orders already coming in ; and a top -

million people  of which only about  million now maintain active stored  value debit card accounts   one company is quickly entering a   trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi  national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching  in just a few months  this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long  term customers that could generate tremendous re  occurring revenues for many years to come   although you have probably never heard of this company  you may soon hear of it even if you don  t continue reading this message  that  s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u  s  within the next year   an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry  in reality  this company  s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you  since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don  t know this company or what they plan to accomplish  their stock is trading at rock bottom prices  but  if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years  this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments   the company that we  ll introduce you to today is  relay capital corp  pink sheets  rlyc   rlyc  which recently went public  is a multi  faceted financial services company that

group cards  travel cards and funds transfer cards  these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally   just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn  t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner  in order to be successful  that company also needs to be truly innovative  have very strong partners  be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality  rlyc appears to be that company   below we  ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition   the potential stored  value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately  million people  of which only about  million now maintain active stored  value debit card accounts   stored  value cards have the potential to help the  million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e  commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities  the implications reverberate across industry segments  estimates suggest stored  value transactions could exceed   trillion in just a few years   rlyc  s focus is on providing stored  value cards to the un  banked and under  banked  these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account  debit card  the size of that group is staggering that  s about one  third of the nation  s work force   rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored  value card programs that make it easy  fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored  value cards as well as for the un  banked and under  banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards   but that  s not all  the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships  in this segment  relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer  who wouldn  t want that  the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc  for the under  and un  banked  collecting their pay  cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming  rlyc  s stored  value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem   rlyc  s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un  banked alike  lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u  s  cards  cards in foreign countries  and services bought through the cards  improved employee retention  improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc  various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system  while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or  hour

during the presentation , the students referred to a market ' s "" critical  mass "" . however , we never defined what we meant by that . we had several  discussions on this topic . i think the best way for enron to think about  this is in terms of the psychology of traders . critical mass gives a market  liquidity . traders seem to think about liquidity in terms of breadth ( how  many products are being traded ) and depth ( the number of bids and offers ) .  our thoughts were that when a trader pulls up a screen , he ( or she ) wants to  see bids , offers , and trades occurring . so a simple ( and cheap ) metric that  enron could use to determine whether rivals are approaching critical mass is  simply to pull up screens and see if trades are occurring , and how quickly .  traders will generally not use a trading platform that lacks "" action "" .  - in terms of new power , i feel it is extremely important that your managers  create an identity for the company . luckily no rival has done this ( though  green energy is closer than most ) . the company that can communicate a  simple and powerful message will create a competitive advantage for itself .  i believe you can differentiate yourself in this market ( though you are  selling a commodity ) . since you are essentially selling service ,  differentiation is always possible .  on a final note , i wanted to ask a favor . my nephew recently graduate from  michigan state university with a degree in business . i brought him to  wharton to work on the tiger projects . this was because i knew he could add  value , and because i thought he needed more experience in some strategy  areas . he served as project coordinator and worked on several projects  ( including enron ) . i was hoping i could get him an interview at enron since  he expressed interest in your company . any help you could offer is  appreciated .  thanks again for making the experience memorable to the students .  keith",0,subject thanks  hi keith   thanks so much for your additional thoughts  which i will definitely pass on  to our business units   as for your nephew  please have him send his resume to me  i  ll be happy to  see what i can do   again  on behalf of enron and everyone involved in the project  especially  vince and i and ken parkhill  we had a great and informative experience with  the entire tiger project   best regards     christie                         forwarded by christie patrick  hou  ect on          am                             weigelt on           pm  to    christie  patrick  enron  com    cc   subject  thanks  christie   i wanted to send a short note to express my thanks to enron  and give some  additional thoughts about the enron presentation  both students and staff  enjoyed our interaction with enron  we hope enron got as much from the  project as we did   i also had some additional thoughts about enrononline    during the presentation  the students referred to a market  s  critical  mass   however  we never defined what we meant by that  we had several  discussions on this topic  i think the best way for enron to think about  this is in terms of the psychology of traders  critical mass gives a market  liquidity  traders seem to think about liquidity in terms of breadth  how  many products are being traded  and depth  the number of bids and offers    our thoughts were that when a trader pulls up a screen  he  or she  wants to  see bids  offers  and trades occurring  so a simple  and cheap  metric that  enron could use to determine whether rivals are approaching critical mass is  simply to pull up screens and see if trades are occurring  and how quickly   traders will generally not use a trading platform that lacks  action     in terms of new power  i feel it is extremely important that your managers  create an identity for the company  luckily no rival has done this  though  green energy is closer than most   the company that can communicate a  simple and powerful message will create a competitive advantage for itself   i believe you can differentiate yourself in this market  though you are  selling a commodity   since you are essentially selling service   differentiation is always possible   on a final note  i wanted to ask a favor  my nephew recently graduate from  michigan state university with a degree in business  i brought him to  wharton to work on the tiger projects  this was because i knew he could add  value  and because i thought he needed more experience in some strategy  areas  he served as project coordinator and worked on several projects   including enron   i was hoping i could get him an interview at enron since  he expressed interest in your company  any help you could offer is  appreciated   thanks again for making the experience memorable to the students   keith

win solutions well within the goi ' s  power to implement , that would in fact enhance his reputation and the  country ' s as one that lives up to its reputation  i would be careful to make the point that we are not going to give up any  value , but are willing to be accomodative to mseb , gom , and goi needs , either  through financial re - engineering , or through getting direct access to the  market in some areas . this will also fly well with enron management that is  more comfortable with market risks than political .  describing the problem  dpc has a ppa , backed by goi mseb ' s  monthy collections not improving - are in the range of rs . 900 cr . / month  mseb , and gom clearly do not have the resources , in the short run ( 3 - 5 yrs . )  to meet these obligations ; hence central intervention is needed .  in a grid of 13000 mw ( maharashtra grid size ) , absorbing an additional 1440  mw ( phase ii ) at one go is difficult ; however if we take western region , grid  size is 42000 mw . clearly absorbing all the power in that framework is much  easier .  to this if we add northern and southern grids , we can probably evacuate out  another 500 - 700 mw through the interconnects . hence , there is definitely  value in looking at this issue at a national level .  additionally , it is not just solvable at that level , but actually answers to  the crying need for power in the country , and hence is a boon for the govt . ,  and should be treated as such .  consequences of not solving the problem  we can call upon the sovereign guarantee , which will cover our partial  payments . however , this would almost definitely lead to a deterioration of  the country ' s credit rating - put back incoming investments into the  petroleum sector ( where private participation program is about to be unveiled  in 25 o we need to get someone to negotiate with . please use  your good offices to quickly form a representative group that includes  central , state govt . , and seb representatives so that we can work on the  solution .  without active participation from pm ' s office , we are likely to waste  precious time bouncing between the seb , gom , and various ministries of goi .  hope this helps .  regards ,  sandeep .",0,subject points for singh meet  vince   please find below a note i had prepared for wade cline who is meeting with a  representative of the prime minister  s office tomorrow   i think you may find these points useful   additionally  i am attaching a copy of a small presentation i made  saturday  in mumbai on roadblocks in the power sector with special reference to wat  needs to be done to start trading   its benefits    i have been working with the henwood team that arrived today  and i think a  good part of the data is now in place  i will be arranging meeting with some  officicals from the transmission side and gather any additional data there  too   krishan got in last night  i conveyed your best wishes to him   we will  hopefully have a useful day with henwood folks tomorrow  i look forward to  being in houston  possibly by the end of the coming week   hope you and the team are doing well    regards   sandeep                         forwarded by sandeep kohli  enron  development on          am                             sandeep kohli          am  to  wade cline  enron  development  enron  development  cc   subject  points for singh meet  wade   please find below a brief note on what i feel your tack should be with  n  k  singh  who is supposed to be a hard negotiator   i am assuming here that  this will be more of an introductory meeting where both sides are feeling out  the other  the two meetings i had arranged over the weekend  would  hopefully  have given you a better idea of the thinking of at least these two  people o the issue   incidentally  in the indian system  the governor of any state is a central  government nominee  he is the eyes and ears of the central govt  in the  state  please see basak  s meeting in that light  the message he takes will  likely go directly to the pmo in delhi  i will therefore be working closely  to convey the right impression   for n  k  singh clearly there are three things you would try to convey   a description of the problem   some of the resultant consequences if it is not solved soon enough  and  conveying the fact that there are win  win solutions well within the goi  s  power to implement  that would in fact enhance his reputation and the  country  s as one that lives up to its reputation  i would be careful to make the point that we are not going to give up any  value  but are willing to be accomodative to mseb  gom  and goi needs  either  through financial re  engineering  or through getting direct access to the  market in some areas  this will also fly well with enron management that is  more comfortable with market risks than political   describing the problem  dpc has a ppa  backed by goi mseb  s  monthy collections not improving  are in the range of rs   cr   month  mseb  and gom clearly do not have the resources  in the short run     yrs    to meet these obligations  hence central intervention is needed   in a grid of  mw  maharashtra grid size   absorbing an additional   mw  phase ii  at one go is difficult  however if we take western region  grid  size is  mw  clearly absorbing all the power in that framework is much  easier   to this if we add northern and southern grids  we can probably evacuate out  another    mw through the interconnects  hence  there is definitely  value in looking at this issue at a national level   additionally  it is not just solvable at that level  but actually answers to  the crying need for power in the country  and hence is a boon for the govt    and should be treated as such   consequences of not solving the problem  we can call upon the sovereign guarantee  which will cover our partial  payments  however  this would almost definitely lead to a deterioration of  the country  s credit rating  put back incoming investments into the  petroleum sector  where private participation program is about to be unveiled  in  o we need to get someone to negotiate with  please use  your good offices to quickly form a representative group that includes  central  state govt   and seb representatives so that we can work on the  solution   without active participation from pm  s office  we are likely to waste  precious time bouncing between the seb  gom  and various ministries of goi   hope this helps   regards   sandeep

"Subject: comments  hi sheridan ,  how are you ? i hope that you had a good vacation . vasant and i looked at  your memo and found it to be interesting . i shall first briefly summarize  our understanding of the methodology you propose . the comments follow .  finally , i shall sketch a simple gas field project you can use as a test case  in further refining the model .  it appears that you are proposing a state - space approach where probabilities  of different states at various future dates are specified . the next step is  to assume a discount rate and to compute the present value by following the  branches from the origin to one of the terminal points . traversing through  the tree in this manner over many iterations will permit us to compute the  average present value of the project . also , you are using the simulation to  assign a value of the project to each node . thus each node will have a cash  flow associated with it which will occur if the node is reached and a value  which is an expectation of the value to be realized going forward . if some  of these values turn out to be negative , zero - coupon , risk - free bonds are  purchased to neutralize the negative realization .  next , we find a comparable and apply the expected rate of return back to our  project ( based on the variance of the returns ) . we iterate until  convergence .  finally , we subtract the initial investment and the computed risk capital  from the pv of the gross cash flows ( including debt ) to determine if the  project merits further consideration .  comments / clarifications  1 . the money is being set aside to avoid negative values . it is not clear  if you mean the values of the cash flow or the pv at the node . anyhow , we  shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes at  that cross - section of time as the risk - free asset pays in all states of  nature . this will have to be done every time there is a negative  realization . thus , for the typical project we have , the value of risk  capital may be extremely high , as we are not following a tail - based norm  anymore .  2 . your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all  values being positive . if so , we are only issuing risk - free debt . also , a  project with a single negative value at each cross - section of time will not  have a positive debt capacity .  3 . it seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate , which is  obtained in each step from the comparison investment ( by equating the  variances ) . it is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such an  effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence . also ,  our project has a finite life and the market - based assets will have infinite  lives . in the light of this fact , how will we define the relevant variance ?  is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison investment ?  4 . finally , our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the investment  and also the risk capital . setting risk capital to zero , this model closely  resembles the intuitive present value criterion and endogenously determines  the discount rate .  gas field case  to facilitate your thinking , we are providing a gas field example below .  we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field . a profile of  expected production and variance of the production per year is available from  the engineers at the beginning . production will be autocorrelated , as the  profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being more or  less than the estimated reserves . we assume the life of the field to be 10  years with no salvage value . there are fixed and variable operating costs .  it might be useful for you to think about applying the framework to this  problem .  do let me know if you have further questions .  rakesh",0,subject comments  hi sheridan   how are you  i hope that you had a good vacation  vasant and i looked at  your memo and found it to be interesting  i shall first briefly summarize  our understanding of the methodology you propose  the comments follow   finally  i shall sketch a simple gas field project you can use as a test case  in further refining the model   it appears that you are proposing a state  space approach where probabilities  of different states at various future dates are specified  the next step is  to assume a discount rate and to compute the present value by following the  branches from the origin to one of the terminal points  traversing through  the tree in this manner over many iterations will permit us to compute the  average present value of the project  also  you are using the simulation to  assign a value of the project to each node  thus each node will have a cash  flow associated with it which will occur if the node is reached and a value  which is an expectation of the value to be realized going forward  if some  of these values turn out to be negative  zero  coupon  risk  free bonds are  purchased to neutralize the negative realization   next  we find a comparable and apply the expected rate of return back to our  project  based on the variance of the returns   we iterate until  convergence   finally  we subtract the initial investment and the computed risk capital  from the pv of the gross cash flows  including debt  to determine if the  project merits further consideration   comments  clarifications    the money is being set aside to avoid negative values  it is not clear  if you mean the values of the cash flow or the pv at the node  anyhow  we  shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes at  that cross  section of time as the risk  free asset pays in all states of  nature  this will have to be done every time there is a negative  realization  thus  for the typical project we have  the value of risk  capital may be extremely high  as we are not following a tail  based norm  anymore     your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all  values being positive  if so  we are only issuing risk  free debt  also  a  project with a single negative value at each cross  section of time will not  have a positive debt capacity     it seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate  which is  obtained in each step from the comparison investment  by equating the  variances   it is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such an  effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence  also   our project has a finite life and the market  based assets will have infinite  lives  in the light of this fact  how will we define the relevant variance   is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison investment     finally  our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the investment  and also the risk capital  setting risk capital to zero  this model closely  resembles the intuitive present value criterion and endogenously determines  the discount rate   gas field case  to facilitate your thinking  we are providing a gas field example below   we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field  a profile of  expected production and variance of the production per year is available from  the engineers at the beginning  production will be autocorrelated  as the  profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being more or  less than the estimated reserves  we assume the life of the field to be   years with no salvage value  there are fixed and variable operating costs   it might be useful for you to think about applying the framework to this  problem   do let me know if you have further questions   rakesh
"Subject: class proposal by yannis  hi vince ,  yannis of the weather desk is planning to develop relationship with prof  rene carmona in doing weather analysis . to start this off , they are planning  to pay prof carmona to give a training class as outlined below , and they  want to know if research is willing to send people and bear part of the costs .  we can talk more at 4 : 00 pm , but while there is no doubt that getting people  from outside to present new ideas is always important and interesting , i  think research group members can easily give most of these talks .  apparently , people are interested in these topics and are willing to pay to  listen . my thought is that if the intent is to develop relationships , that  is fine , but the research group should also be given the opportunity to  provide more training and get more visibility . i have already communicated  this to joe and to yannis .  vasant  -

"Subject: data for moody ' s riskcalc  craig and kim ,  as you know , i have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to moody ' s  riskcalc .  you wanted to know if it makes sense for enron to purchase riskcalc .  well , after plowing through their 100 page manual and sitting through  today ' s 2 - hour moody ' s presentation , it is necessary for us to have  information about enron ' s counterparties to move to the next step with  riskcalc .  we have obtained some information on enron ' s european counterparties from  our colleagues in the london office .  we need for you and / or your colleagues in the houston office to supply us  with a list of enron ' s north american counterparties .  more specifically , to evaluate moody ' s riskcalc we will need the following  financial inputs for enron ' s north american ( private firm ) counterparties :  fiscal year  the prior twelve months of financial data are represented . annual statements  are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables ,  such as cost of goods sold , net income , sales , and ebit . the value should be  a four - digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or  2000 . forecasts until the year 2009 can be made . a constant rate of inflation  is applied to future years using last year ' s ( 1999 ) inflation level . in  general this ' estimation error ' will not cause any great problems , as size  affects default rates at very large scales ( e . g . , $ 10 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 000 , 000  makes a significant difference , $ 1 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 050 , 00 does not ) .  cash & equivalents  this measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities .  inventory  inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet , in thousands dollars ,  without any alterations for accounting method ( e . g . , lifo , fifo , average  cost ) . this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and  supplies purchased for use in production of revenue . specifically this would  include purchase cost , sales cost , sales taxes , transportation costs ,  insurance costs , and storage costs .  current assets  this item primarily represents cash , inventories , accounts receivables ,  marketable securities , and other current assets .  total assets  total assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars .  for example , $ 15 , 500 , 000 should be entered as 15500 . specifically , total  assets are the sum of current assets plus net property , plant , and equipment  plus other noncurrent assets ( including intangible assets , deferred items ,  and investments and advances ) . leave previous year ' s total assets blank for  australian companies .  current liabilities  liabilities are positive values . included in current liabilities are  short - term debt , accounts payable , and other current liabilities .  total liabilities  this balance sheet account , total liabilities , is a positive number  representing the sum of current liabilities plus long - term debt plus other  noncurrent liabilities ( including deferred taxes , investment tax credit , and  minority interest ) .  retained earnings  retained earnings , a historical measure of performance , is the cumulative  earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders .  typically , it is the prior year ' s retained earnings plus net income less  distributions . retained earnings are generally positive . some firms with low  credit quality will have negative retained earnings . leave this field blank  for australian companies .  sales  this item consists of the industry segment ' s gross sales ( the amount of  actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period )  reduced by cash discounts , trade discounts , and returned sales and allowances  for which credit is given to customers .  cost of goods sold  entered in thousands of dollars , this value is generally a positive number  less than sales . it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to  production , such as material , labor , and overhead . not fixed overhead or  items that would be included in selling , general , and administrative  expenses . leave this field blank for australian companies .  ebit  earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation . it  can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income .  interest expense  this item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short -  and long - term debt . typically , we expect this charge to be approximately the  prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities . one measure of  computing this is : interest expense = 0 . 07 * total liabilities .  net income  this item represents the income ( or loss ) reported by a company after  expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the  fiscal period including extraordinary items and

( note : auction - > one  seller and many buyers : exchange - > many sellers and many buyers . )  moreover , i think auctioning the unsold bandwidth will not hurt us because we  cannot sell them anyway . in addition , we ourselves can be a dummy bidder in  the system and bid in the auction . if the current wining bid is too low , we  can just over - bid it and keep the product . this way , we can indirectly put a  reserve price on the products .  let ' s meet sometime in the first week of january .  - chonawee",0,subject combinatorial auction  jan  mtg background       forwarded by greg woulfe  enron communications on         am       chonawee supatgiat  enron          pm  to  stinson gibner  hou  ect  ect  greg woulfe  enron communications  enron  communications  cc   subject  combinatorial auction  stinson and greg   i have read the paper  combinatorial auction with multiple winners for  universal service  from richard steinberg and frank kelly  they propose a  combinatorial auction which is an auction for multiple items that allows  bidders to realize their synergies on combinations of items  the  combinatorial auction is appropriated for bandwidth commodity because most  bidders in the market have synergies on the combination of items  for  example  if we want to get bandwidth between boston and dc  we would bid for  boston  ny and ny  dc  it will be valuable to us only if we won both links  if  we won only one link  it will be useless   in the paper  they propose the auctioning method but their method has not  been tested or validated yet  i have not checked their proposition  mathematically but their paper was published in management science so i think  it should be all right  i will look at it in more details and let you know   anyhow  there are also other combinatorial auctions that are actually used   for example  the alberta government  s ppa auction that enron canada was  participated    months ago   based on our long position on bandwidth  auction and exchange might be a good  channel to dispose our unused  or unsold  bandwidth  i know there is not much  demand in the market  but if we open a combinatorial auction or exchange  we  might be able to increase our market share   by taking demand from our  competitors   i believe  at the moment  there are no bandwidth exchanges that  allow  combinatorial  bids  if we are the first one to do it  we might  improve our sale channel and gain some market share   note  auction   one  seller and many buyers  exchange   many sellers and many buyers    moreover  i think auctioning the unsold bandwidth will not hurt us because we  cannot sell them anyway  in addition  we ourselves can be a dummy bidder in  the system and bid in the auction  if the current wining bid is too low  we  can just over  bid it and keep the product  this way  we can indirectly put a  reserve price on the products   let  s meet sometime in the first week of january    chonawee

"Subject: pricing credit on thousands of names  all -  our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to  provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [ 5 , 000 by year - end ] .  most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information ,  making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of  competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we  plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective .  currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under  development :  fmc model ( default probability approach ) . using bloomberg ' s fair market ( par  yield ) curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then  default / bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology .  fmc model ( credit spread approach ) . using the fmcs , then directly taking the  libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding  differences .  bond model ( fmc approach ) . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model  regresses the input bonds ( specific to a name ) on the two best fitting  benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs ,  but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated  using both spread and probability approaches . under testing .  bond model ( spline approach ) . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer ,  the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve ,  then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing .  market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors / ratings , cds market  prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap  prices .  kmv . using expected default frequencies ( edfs ) from the kmv model and  database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate  risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next .  each of these models returns a price ( credit default and bankruptcy ) , and the  accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory  differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia ,  capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid  names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside  other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing  system .  our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and  market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific ' soft ' data from  credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a  price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the  credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial  information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights .  the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with  market ( or trader ) prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the  weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the  system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid  market prices ( bonds , equities , default swaps ) , where the weightings are  calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc .  the key steps to implementing such a system will be :  establishing what exactly we want to ' predict ' - is it a price , a rating , a  probability , or a score ? we will need a clean market history to calibrate to ,  which we only really have for ratings . we will then need to develop a mapping  from rating / score to price .  getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to  calibrate the model .  building the mechanics of the model , ie , the calibration methodology . neural  nets / fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates , but which exact methods and  software packages to use ?  determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited  information into the model .  getting the "" true "" market price , in order to feed back an error . at present  such a price exists for very few credits .  allocating resources to the development . mckinsey claimed such a system would  take 6 - 10 man - months to develop .  further ideas or comments are requested , as we need to develop our strategy  asap . the model description above is fairly vague , as we don ' t yet have the  knowledge needed to fill in the specific details . further help will be  especially required on this if we are to continue to move at ' internet speed ' .  regards  ben",0,subject pricing credit on thousands of names  all   our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to  provide differential pricing on thousands of credits     by year  end    most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information   making the challenge harder  and the end result more important in terms of  competitive pricing advantage  what we need is an overall strategy for how we  plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective   currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under  development   fmc model  default probability approach   using bloomberg  s fair market  par  yield  curves  probabilities are generated from the risky  libor  then  default  bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology   fmc model  credit spread approach   using the fmcs  then directly taking the  libor credit spread at each tenor  adjusting for basis and compounding  differences   bond model  fmc approach   taking the fmcs as benchmark curves  the model  regresses the input bonds  specific to a name  on the two best fitting  benchmarks  the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs   but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer  prices are then generated  using both spread and probability approaches  under testing   bond model  spline approach   taking only the bonds specific to an issuer   the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero  coupon price curve   then builds a zero yield curve from this  under testing   market prices  for certain liquid names  or sectors  ratings  cds market  prices are used  then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap  prices   kmv  using expected default frequencies  edfs  from the kmv model and  database  we will build a model to price default swaps  making appropriate  risk adjustments  kmv is being installed now  so model will be worked on next   each of these models returns a price  credit default and bankruptcy   and the  accuracy of the price depends on many factors  liquidity and regulatory  differences between bond and cds markets  recovery assumptions  risk premia   capital charges  etc  the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid  names as possible  based upon these models  then use these prices  alongside  other financial information  as the backbone to a full automated pricing  system   our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and  market prices for all issuers  alongside name  specific  soft  data from  credit reports and financial statements  if the credit is liquid enough  a  price will be generated from their own information only  otherwise  the  credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits  with financial  information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights   the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with  market  or trader  prices  and this adjustment will feed back into the  weighting and mapping composition  in loose terms  we could think of the  system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid  market prices  bonds  equities  default swaps   where the weightings are  calibrated using credit analysis  financial ratios  etc   the key steps to implementing such a system will be   establishing what exactly we want to  predict   is it a price  a rating  a  probability  or a score  we will need a clean market history to calibrate to   which we only really have for ratings  we will then need to develop a mapping  from rating  score to price   getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to  calibrate the model   building the mechanics of the model  ie  the calibration methodology  neural  nets  fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates  but which exact methods and  software packages to use   determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited  information into the model   getting the  true  market price  in order to feed back an error  at present  such a price exists for very few credits   allocating resources to the development  mckinsey claimed such a system would  take    man  months to develop   further ideas or comments are requested  as we need to develop our strategy  asap  the model description above is fairly vague  as we don  t yet have the  knowledge needed to fill in the specific details  further help will be  especially required on this if we are to continue to move at  internet speed    regards  ben
"Subject: re : default rates  mark , this is a good point . in moody ' s june 1999 study , debt recoveries for  corporate bankruptcies , there is a graph of firm - level recovery rates by year  of bankruptcy resolution ( as opposed to default year ) . reading from the  graph finds :  as the data above is based on resolution year , the same study finds the  average length of time spent in bankruptcy is 1 . 30 years ( median 1 . 15 years  and standard deviation of 1 . 20 years ) . the interesting point is the slide in  recovery value 1996 to 1998 . one would wonder if the mix of high - yield  issuance slanted towards the tech companies would yield lower recoveries  ( quick technological obsolescence - - little tangible recovery value ) .  interesting to note is the december 1999 to december 2000 change in spreads .  the table below divides the december 2000 spreads by the december 1999  spreads . one would have expected a pronounced flight to safety over this  time -

( attached is a  summary of this issue . ) the board is expected to vote on this issue during  may 2001 . eei will be taking steps to appraise fasb of our concerns . if  you , or company cfo would

a bill that repeals the  public utility holding company act of 1935 . the bill would repeal puhca and  transfer oversight of public utility holding companies from the securities  and exchange commission to the federal energy regulatory commission and  appropriate state agencies .  s . 206 was approved with two amendments . offered by sen . mike enzi ( r - wy ) ,  the first amendment would establish the electric energy market competition  task force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for  electric energy in the united states . the task force would be made up of  representatives of ferc , the department of justice and the federal trade  commission , as well as non - voting representatives from the department of  agriculture and the securities and exchange commission . the amendment also  contained a provision , co - sponsored by sen . paul sarbanes ( d - md ) , that would  preserve ferc ' s authority to require that energy rates are reasonable and do  not include the pass - through of holding company costs that are unrelated to  energy .  another amendment , offered by sen . jon corzine ( d - nj ) , initiated a study by  the general accounting office of the success of federal and state governments  in preventing anticompetitive practices by public utility holding companies  and in promoting competition and efficient energy markets .  * * * institute   s tax agreement with public power again introduced on hill * * *  the tax agreement eei reached with the american public power association  ( appa ) and the large public power council (

congress . hr 1459 was introduced by rep . j . d . hayworth ( r - az ) and nine  original co - sponsors from the ways and means committee .  hr 1459 contains four key provisions with tax code changes : 1 ) the tax - free  sale or spin - off of transmission assets into an rto is allowed , 2 ) nuclear  decommissioning laws are adapted to a competitive market by allowing  deductions to a trust fund no longer subject to cost - of service ratemaking ,  3 ) the contributions in aid of construction ( ciac ) tax on interconnections to  transmission and distribution facilities is eliminated , and 4 ) private use  tax rules are changed to permit open access to transmission and distribution  facilities .  the measure was referred to the house ways and means committee , and eei has  urged congress to act without delay in moving it forward . enactment will  help encourage a vigorous but fair competitive environment , the institute  noted . the same legislation has been incorporated into s 389 , senate energy  committee chairman frank murkowski ' s ( r - ak ) energy security bill , and  stand - alone legislation could also be introduced . hearings are expected to  be held in both the senate finance and house ways and means committees ,  probably after consideration of president bush ' s individual tax proposal .  administration / ferc  * * * white house seeks $ 2 trillion budget in fiscal year 2002 * * *  president bush last week transmitted a $ 2 trillion fiscal year 2002 budget  request to capitol hill . the administration noted that its proposal  * moderates recent explosive growth in discretionary spending to four percent  in 2002 , * an increase of $ 26 billion over the preceding fiscal year . the  budget bid contains a $ 231 billion total surplus in 2002 , and projects a $ 5 . 6  trillion surplus over the next ten years .  in the energy area , the administration noted the federal government   s  * longstanding and evolving role * in the sector , pointing out that most  federal energy programs and agencies have no state or private counterparts .  it proposed about $ 2 . 8 billion in discretionary spending for energy programs ,  and about $ 2 . 1 billion in tax benefits , * mainly to encourage development of  traditional and alternative energy sources . * doe   s budget request was $ 19 . 2  billion , including $ 2 . 3 billion for energy resources programs . this later  figure represents a decrease of $ 196 million , or 7 . 9 percent , from fiscal  year 2001 .  in the environmental sector , the administration sought some $ 7 . 3 billion in  discretionary funding for epa , including a $ 3 . 7 billion operating program  focused on implementation of most federal pollution control laws .  * * * success of restructuring tied to energy strategy , ferc   s massey asserts * * *  electric restructuring may be in jeopardy , and its success * is in the hands  of regulators and policymakers , * ferc commissioner william massey has  asserted . speaking at a recent national governors association policy forum  in philadelphia , commissioner massey urged officials to pay attention to the  key elements of a national energy strategy .  first , he specified , there is a need for an adequate supply of the energy  commodity . turning to a second element , commissioner massey told forum  attendees that * all the supply in the world won   t help unless it can be  delivered over an adequate , efficient , non - discriminatory network . *  commissioner massey identified market structure as the third essential  element of a national energy strategy , while citing an inherent difficulty :  that * good structure cannot be easily parsed between wholesale and retail  jurisdictions . * accordingly , he said , ferc and the states must work together  on market structure .  the final element of a successful energy strategy , the commissioner  specified , is the need for aggressive ferc intervention when markets fail to  do their job

"Subject: california update 4 / 27 / 01  the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please  treat with discretion .  executive summary :  ? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives .  politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis ; from  an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new  power generation  ? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of  out - of - state generators  ? june lst "" kill clause "" for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional  plan  ? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected  $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper  administration involvement  ? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court  ? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling  ? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout  deal  1 . ferc fallout  the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks  like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to  continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to  allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape  shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the  administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the  administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the  forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps  on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the  construction of new generation .  it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were  generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who  favors price caps actually voted against this plan .  2 . something less than effective price caps  from davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws :  ? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west .  non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to  california .  ? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power  than a ceiling .  ? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game  the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2  emergency and does not require any collusion .  ? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the  highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require  wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the  cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc .  3 . proposal "" kill clause "" adds to the political dilemma for davis  the ferc proposal includes a "" kill clause "" that says the caps will be  withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the  regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the  regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines  blaming him for letting the "" bush price caps plan "" collapse .  4 . growing fiscal risk in california  sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion  on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of  pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the  situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take  further action to control prices for power .  the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about  90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to  finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals .  the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge  loans they are providing to california .  the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness  of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will  have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating  deficits in a matter of months .  5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & e  meanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the  bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts ,  since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for  gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the  qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw  of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline .  6 delays likely in new qf generation  the qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being  continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those  contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated .  7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan  harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an  analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a  utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number  of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a  "" non - bypassable "" charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even  if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is  no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be  used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would  be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according  to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private  company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for  the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not  stand a likely constitutional challenge .  8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long - term power contracts  the issue of the governor ' s failure to disclose the details of the long - term  power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis .  even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been  negotiating , it is likely that their actions and negotiations will  challenged , creating an even further delay .",0,subject california update       the

in both the near and long  terms   symbol   vnbl   current price      short term target price       month target price         why we believe vnbl  ob will give big returns on investment      at this time much of vnbl  s focus is on rfid  radio frequency  identification  technology  this is technology which uses tiny sensors  to  transmit information about a person or object wirelessly    vnbl is already an industry pioneer in the rfid personal location  technology    vnbl is developing a form of rfid technology which allows companies  and  governments to wirelessly track their assets and resources  such  technology  has huge potential in the protection and transportation of materials  designated  high risk  were they to fall into the wrong hands    vnbl works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order  to  create  high security space  in locales where it is deemed necessary   locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports  sea  ports   mines  nuclear facilities  and more    as with all stocks  news drives the short term price  fresh news has  made vnbl a hot buy   news on vnbl  malibu  calif     business wire    june      vinoble  inc    otcbb  vnbl   news   a holding company seeking to identify long  term growth  opportunities  in the areas of homeland security  security information systems  and  other  security services  announced today that it plans to offer products and  services that will assist in the automation of the identification and  control of equipment  assets  tools  and the related processes used in  the  oil  gas and petrochemical industries   although small wirelessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines  and  equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious  they  can  also deliver safety features within oil wells  oil maybe trapped in  different layers of rock  along with gas and water  detection of  specific  liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise  opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur   such as  a well filling with water   as with other rf based technology applications  rfid can also provide  the  safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler  and limit the  entry of personnel to specific locations  ensuring personnel safety is  essential  should there be an emergency at a facility  rfid tags would  enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee  s safety and  or  danger  this application technology requires product and hardware that  can  operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions  but gives  valuable  safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer  rfid  can  also assist the customer  s supply chain by tracking oil  gas  and  chemical  products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level   vinoble  s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are  more  than just a valuable tool to the mining industry  but as a protective  measure of our country  s natural resources and commodities against  threat   preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of  u  s   industry and economy   the company believes that such offering service and technology  application  in the oil  gas and petrochemical industry will further position  vinoble in  a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the  increasing capital and global spending that the company will require  for  growth  the company  s goal is to also provide a much  needed service at  a  cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can  t afford to  do  without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of  constant threat   this is outstanding news  the growth potential for this company is  exceptional  in an already hot industry  vnbl  ob stands out as a truly  innovative pioneer  we see big things happening to this stock   information within this email contains

"Subject: re : short - sell vs exercise  chonawee ,  as i have pointed out , short - selling the stock may be a bad  decision because of tax implications ( ignoring the legal aspects ) .  suppose the strike is $ 70 and you were granted an atm option .  you sell short at $ 70 ten lots ( one lot = 100 shares ) . the price goes to  $ 100 .  you lose $ 30 x 1000 = $ 30 , 000 on your short position . option exercise  gives you $ 30 , 000 . this is before taxes . you pay taxes  on your option income ( it ' s treated as ordinary income ) . the tax is  28 % x $ 30 , 000 = $ 8 , 400 . you can use only $ 3 , 000 of your loss against  ordinary income . this saves you only $ 840 in taxes .  of course , if you have capital gains , you can use losses on your option  position  as an offset .  the remaining part of your capital loss is carried forward and you get the  tax benefits over time ( less the time value of money ) , assuming you have  income in the  future ( or capital gains ) .  not so good .  by the way , valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options  is a very interesting and difficult problem .  vince  chonawee supatgiat @ enron  07 / 10 / 2000 11 : 40 am  to : stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : short - sell vs exercise  below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere . it  explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised  but cannot be sold . ( as we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call  option before its maturity ) . however , after taking vince ' s comments on the  ordinary income / capital loss tax offsetting issue , i think this is not a good  article anymore . i guess i could just throw this article away . : - )  - chonawee  short - selling is better than exercising your employee stock options  in general , the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when  you speculate that ene is going down or its growth rate is extremely low . in  fact , when exercising the options , you are speculating that ene would never  reach this point ( plus interest ) again during the 10 years maturity date or  until you leave the company . if you do not anticipate that , you should hold  on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your  exercise .  however , if you believe that ene is reaching its peak . then , instead of  exercising the options , you should short - sell ( or sell ) the stocks in that  amount . after short - selling , when you feel that the stock starts to go up ,  you can buy them back ( to cover ) , make profit , and still keep the options . on  the other hand , if the stock does not go down as expect , you can exercise the  options to cover your short position anytime .  let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes , no dividends ,  and zero risk - free rate . suppose that ene follows a simple sample path as  follow  if you exercise 100 ene options with a grant price of 45 when ene reaches 70 ,  you would earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . but if you short sell 100 ene at 70 , no  matter how much ene is in the future , you can exercise the options to cover  the short position and still earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . the advantage of  short - selling comes when ene at the period 2 is 60 . at this point , you can  cover your short position , get ( 70 - 60 ) * 100 = $ 1 , 000 , and still keep your  options or you can exercise the options and gain $ 2 , 500 . that is , you still  keep the flexibility of your options when you short - sell . in conclusion , the  only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your  short position .",0,subject re  short  sell vs exercise  chonawee   as i have pointed out  short  selling the stock may be a bad  decision because of tax implications  ignoring the legal aspects    suppose the strike is   and you were granted an atm option   you sell short at   ten lots  one lot   shares   the price goes to      you lose   x       on your short position  option exercise  gives you      this is before taxes  you pay taxes  on your option income  it  s treated as ordinary income   the tax is    x           you can use only     of your loss against  ordinary income  this saves you only   in taxes   of course  if you have capital gains  you can use losses on your option  position  as an offset   the remaining part of your capital loss is carried forward and you get the  tax benefits over time  less the time value of money   assuming you have  income in the  future  or capital gains    not so good   by the way  valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options  is a very interesting and difficult problem   vince  chonawee supatgiat  enron          am  to  stinson gibner  hou  ect  ect  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  cc   subject  short  sell vs exercise  below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere  it  explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised  but cannot be sold   as we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call  option before its maturity   however  after taking vince  s comments on the  ordinary income  capital loss tax offsetting issue  i think this is not a good  article anymore  i guess i could just throw this article away       chonawee  short  selling is better than exercising your employee stock options  in general  the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when  you speculate that ene is going down or its growth rate is extremely low  in  fact  when exercising the options  you are speculating that ene would never  reach this point  plus interest  again during the  years maturity date or  until you leave the company  if you do not anticipate that  you should hold  on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your  exercise   however  if you believe that ene is reaching its peak  then  instead of  exercising the options  you should short  sell  or sell  the stocks in that  amount  after short  selling  when you feel that the stock starts to go up   you can buy them back  to cover   make profit  and still keep the options  on  the other hand  if the stock does not go down as expect  you can exercise the  options to cover your short position anytime   let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes  no dividends   and zero risk  free rate  suppose that ene follows a simple sample path as  follow  if you exercise  ene options with a grant price of  when ene reaches    you would earn              but if you short sell  ene at   no  matter how much ene is in the future  you can exercise the options to cover  the short position and still earn              the advantage of  short  selling comes when ene at the period  is   at this point  you can  cover your short position  get              and still keep your  options or you can exercise the options and gain      that is  you still  keep the flexibility of your options when you short  sell  in conclusion  the  only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your  short position

( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with  market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that  most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them  and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting ,  asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options  valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s  real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate  these problems by imposing a market disciplining .  ( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials ,  credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have  options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the  story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets  enron has been moving into over the last few years .  on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when  you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am  working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be  wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room .  i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss  some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the  room would be very important to me .  as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 ,  may 3 / 4 are good for me .  regards  nalin  at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote :  > hi ,  >  > as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr .  > martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some  > time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options ,  > etc .  >  > martin and i are working on various broadband related problems .  >  > we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about  > the following :  > * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly  > catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) .  >  > * a description of what you want to talk about with respect  > to telecoms , broadband , etc .  > * who you would like to meet with me -

although its been at forc for 2 months . i think that the  empirical chapter is probably the one which would be of most relevance to  both our company ' s businesses - although i ultimately didn ' t have the time  to ' explicitly ' price the jump risk - premium which i conjectured is possibly  implicit in the prices of exchange - traded electricity futures - options -  rather i developed an implicit estimation procedure which will enable a  rough assessment ( with a little bit of further work , but not too much ) be  made of the price of jump risk in wholesale power markets .  in other words , i assumed spot jump - risk to be undiversifiable , and  essentially devoted 2 theoretical chapters to :  1 ) proving that a jump - diffusion trading model is "" incomplete "" ( synthesising  the securities markets framework with martingale representation theory ) -  note that i did not assume that markets could be dynamically completed with  ' term structure ' securities as in the hjm w / jumps papers of shirakawa and  das and ;  2 ) deriving an explicit risk - adjustment process for ' implementing ' the price  of jump - risk using a jump - diffusion marginal indirect utility of wealth  process ( ie . a jump - augmented production economy approach in the spirit of  cir , bates , ahn whereas in the latter the driftless forward supposition  means that i have to capture mean -

"Subject: credit applicatiions in grms  this note is from ted murphy ( not bjorn hagelman )  my understanding is that yet another meeting has been scheduled with the  intent of diverting resources from the grms project to some other project .  while i am not privy to the urgency of this other project , i do know that we  have a very large , multi - phase project going in grms .  grms stands for the global risk monitoring system . it is not intended to be  a commercial trading product not is its primary purpose for commercial  decision - making . conceptually , it is a risk warehouse for the primary  purpose of rac due to the deficiency of current front office trading systems  and their inability to provide timely , aggregated information useful to rac .  rac has spent over a year developing a business plan scope and detailed task  list to accomplish its objectives . as a firm we are woefully behind our  press clippings in our ability to aggregate and understand our risk profile .  my most recent sojorn in europe is a classic example of the current systems  inabilty to aggregate and meet the needs of rac having abetted poor decision  making and causing cash losses in well in excess of the grms budget or that  of the market risk group in rac .  the grms project is a requirement that bill bradford and i have in order to  do our jobs . we have delegated authority to debbie brackett and rudi zipter  to make decisions regarding priorities and as such meet regularly with  jonathon and his team as well as rick buy to provide updates . while progress  is never as fast as we would like it , in every instance in which we have only  to rely on rac , jonathon ' s team and research to make a deadline it haas been  hit . the primary reason for any delays whatsoever has been the diversion of  resources off the project or the reliance for cooperation from some other  source - most recently the it staff in london was a tremendous impediment to  deadlines .  please excuse the frustration that is apparently coming through in this note ,  but i feel like the boy with his finger in the dyke and no one is listening .  also , i have had several employees come to resignation over their frustration  on the lack of management support for this project , usually manifesting  itself in the lack of resources or the diversion of resources devoted to it .  i think we have proven collectively that we can organize a modular multiphase  project and provide tangible deliverables when not distracted . please let us  do our jobs . i do not denigrate the efforts of others , but i believe that  they must either submit their detailed requirements to us for our  consideration of their worthiness to put in our que or develop their own  project with their own resources .  thank you for your consideration of this opinion . as it relates to things  that will effect the ability of market risk to do its job , please consult me  as i would you .  ted",0,subject credit applicatiions in grms  this note is from ted murphy  not bjorn hagelman   my understanding is that yet another meeting has been scheduled with the  intent of diverting resources from the grms project to some other project   while i am not privy to the urgency of this other project  i do know that we  have a very large  multi  phase project going in grms   grms stands for the global risk monitoring system  it is not intended to be  a commercial trading product not is its primary purpose for commercial  decision  making  conceptually  it is a risk warehouse for the primary  purpose of rac due to the deficiency of current front office trading systems  and their inability to provide timely  aggregated information useful to rac   rac has spent over a year developing a business plan scope and detailed task  list to accomplish its objectives  as a firm we are woefully behind our  press clippings in our ability to aggregate and understand our risk profile   my most recent sojorn in europe is a classic example of the current systems  inabilty to aggregate and meet the needs of rac having abetted poor decision  making and causing cash losses in well in excess of the grms budget or that  of the market risk group in rac   the grms project is a requirement that bill bradford and i have in order to  do our jobs  we have delegated authority to debbie brackett and rudi zipter  to make decisions regarding priorities and as such meet regularly with  jonathon and his team as well as rick buy to provide updates  while progress  is never as fast as we would like it  in every instance in which we have only  to rely on rac  jonathon  s team and research to make a deadline it haas been  hit  the primary reason for any delays whatsoever has been the diversion of  resources off the project or the reliance for cooperation from some other  source  most recently the it staff in london was a tremendous impediment to  deadlines   please excuse the frustration that is apparently coming through in this note   but i feel like the boy with his finger in the dyke and no one is listening   also  i have had several employees come to resignation over their frustration  on the lack of management support for this project  usually manifesting  itself in the lack of resources or the diversion of resources devoted to it   i think we have proven collectively that we can organize a modular multiphase  project and provide tangible deliverables when not distracted  please let us  do our jobs  i do not denigrate the efforts of others  but i believe that  they must either submit their detailed requirements to us for our  consideration of their worthiness to put in our que or develop their own  project with their own resources   thank you for your consideration of this opinion  as it relates to things  that will effect the ability of market risk to do its job  please consult me  as i would you   ted

as has largely been the case so far  the steps taken will fail  to move the california power market toward a more enduring solution and will  instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws   in the six months since california  s supply shortfall began plaguing western  markets  regulators have done little to address the underlying problem   rather than addressing the cause of the supply

the absence   and even discouragement  of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in  the state  particularly for residential and small commercial customers  with  the market at a peak  however  now is in one sense a sub  optimal time to move  toward term contracting  yet these contracts provide the foundation for a  series of actions  including new supply build and demand side investments  if  they end up above market  they will at least have achieved the desired effect  of knocking down prices  a fact which by itself should provide sufficient  justification for recovering the cost of these commitments    encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response  although  originally a feature of california  s market design  most consumers are  insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates  exposing  customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a  demand response    encourage market mechanisms that dampen the  boom bust  characteristic of  the market  whether in the form of a capacity payment  a reserve requirement   or a minimum term portfolio requirement  the california power market needs to  move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the  market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to  elicit new investment  such a structure can help dampen  but not eliminate   future price volatility    avoid continuously tinkering with the market  while the market does need to  be restructured as described above  it also needs to be stable and reliable  to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long  term  contractual market for power in california  continually tinkering with the  market structure  such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since  july  only serves to undermine confidence in the market  california needs to  do its best to develop a long  term solution and then let the market run its  course    allow for greater environmental flexibility  the state should explore a  more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply  shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to  emissions restrictions    free purpa power plants to generate  relief should be granted to purpa  power plants that are operational  but are restricted by contract from

we should not  focus solely on the uk but ensure that we use risk trac for continental power  and gas  uk power and gas  nordic power   to use risk trac i think the following need to be resolved first  to  implement it  right the first time   as i think it is incorrect to consider  the risk trac numbers  as the most accurate  since it depends on the validity  of these items   positions  delta and gamma  and curve mapping  these need to include all  positions including those outside the main risk systems  positions  curves and mapping should now be no problem given the feeds   apart from continental power  have been uat  d and we have the spreadsheet  feeds up and running   price and vol curves  as used by the risk systems  as above  inter commodity correlation  prompt month  correlation should be easy to calculate given an accurate and complete data  set  however the incomplete historic data for europe in risk trac  prior to  the formation of the task force  would mean a full data set needs to be  obtained and used   term structure of correlation would be good but i  understand this is difficult to use in the calculation   factor loadings  i think factor loadings should be calculated  on the same data sets used  for inter commodity correlation  for all commodities  if this analysis does  not appear to work i am not sure that using factor loadings for other markets  is adequate  do we need to consider an alternative approach to calculating  var for these markets   to ensure this moves forward i think a list of the mile stones   responsibilities and time

hope you are well .  ?  we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and  you kindly offered that you would provide this . ? is this still possible ? ? we  realise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ahead and wrote  something , which is below , and if you want to review , change or re - write ? the  preface , that would be very appreciated . ? let me know what your thoughts are .  ?  thanks ,  julie  ( we ' re getting close )  ?  ?  preface  ?  ?  ?  one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk  management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for  the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible , to discuss  in - depth the models , and to show how they relate to each other . ? in this  way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide  range of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses  a consistent modelling framework . ? we believe that for practitioners this  last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving  arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent  models for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose  consistent models ? ) . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one  particular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we  believe that the choice should rest with the user ( although it will probably  be clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we prefer ) . ? we therefore try and  give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all  the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models  which best suit their needs .  ?  in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model  and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ?  in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout  the book .  ?  in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that  can be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of  geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility  and jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated  and their parameters estimated .  ?  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ?  this chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods ,  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different  pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and  electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative  aspects of calculating volatility .  ?  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such  curves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial  markets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well  defined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy  prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we  outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building  forward curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric  approach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic  factors .  ?  chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options , and ladder options .  ?  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the  models in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience  yield and interest rate model .  ?  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and  american style options .  ?  chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach  results in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the  evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined  volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form  solutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient  monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter  closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options .  ?  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ?  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the  problem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a  portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging  )  illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the  general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor  hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  ?  chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . ? we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma ,  historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same  portfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the  var estimates for various underlying energy market variables .  ?  finally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we  look in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan  ( 1997 ) ) and creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial products ( 1997 ) ) for which  detailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an  extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present  numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives .  ?  before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of  how both the  + tool  , and the market works . ? the techniques we describe are  certainly not  & magic wands  8 which can be waved at data and risk management  problems to provide instant and perfect solutions . ? to quote from the  riskmetrics technical document  &  ( no amount of sophisticated

"Subject: alliance info alert  ferc acts to remove obstacles to address western energy crisis  * * omnibus order mobilizes ferc ' s entire energy pricing and infrastructure  authority  * * to adopt financial incentives for capacity increases in transmission  facilities  * * streamlines regulation of wholesale market , energy facilities siting and  licensing  * * promotes conservation and wholesale side of demand - response bidding  * * order doesn ' t address price caps  * * meeting with western state regulators / officials set for april 6 , 2001 in  boise , idaho  ferc moves to bring more economic and reliable energy supplies to the  stressed california and western energy markets . ferc proposes to increase  bulk power supply in the west by removing barriers and providing incentives  that are within its jurisdiction over facility certification , licensing , and  the regulation of transmission and wholesale power sales in interstate  commerce . ferc quickly wants to increase electric generation and  transmission capacity , as well as to streamline the regulation of wholesale  power transactions , as well as increase the capacity of the supporting  infrastructure of natural gas and oil pipelines . the order , which sets new  precedent in its broadness , also proposes actions to reduce electricity  demand in the west as well as promoting the necessary wholesale - market  portion of demand - response bidding where states wish to implement the retail  side . ferc asks for comments on additional actions it may take in the future  by march 30 , 2001 .  effective immediately , ferc said in a statement , * the commission is  streamlining regulatory procedures for wholesale electric power sales ,  expediting the certification of natural gas pipeline projects into california  and the west , including the reallocation of staff resources to more quickly  address pending pipeline applications , and urging all licensees to review  their ferc - licensed hydroelectric projects in order to assess the potential  for increased generating capacity . *  among the actions ferc takes are to : 1 ) require the california iso and  transmission owners within all 11 states of the western systems coordinating  council ( wscc ) to prepare a list of grid enhancements that can be completed  in the short term ;

based rate reflecting a 300 basis point premium return on equity and a  10 - year depreciable life . projects in service by november 1 , 2001 , would get  a 200 basis point premium and 10 - year depreciable life . ferc would use a  uniform baseline return on equity for all jurisdictional transmission  providers in wscc of 11 . 5 % , based on the roe ferc approved for southern  california edison .  system upgrades that involve new rights of way , add significant transfer  capability and can be in service by november 1 , 2002 , would get a cost - based  rate reflecting 12 . 5 % roe , or al 00 basis point premium , and 15 - year  depreciable life .  facilities needed to interconnect new supply to the grid , which go into  service as required to accommodate the in - service date of the new plant would  get a cost - based rate that reflected a 13 . 5 % roe , or a 200 basis point  premium , if in service by november 1 , 2001 and 12 . 5 % roe if in service by  november 1 , 2002 .  for increases in transmission capacity on constrained interfaces that do not  involve significant capital investments , for example , installing new  technology , ferc proposes to allow transmission owners to increase the  revenue requirement of their network service rates to ensure that each  additional mw of capacity will generate revenues equal to their current firm  point - to - point rate . ferc requests comment on whether to assign the cost of  any interconnection or system upgrade to a particular load or supply , or  alternatively , to roll these costs into the average system rate .  extension of waivers for qfs  ferc proposes to extend its temporary waivers of operating and efficiency  standards for qfs - applicable throughout wscc - to allow increased  generation through december 31 , 2001 . the waivers were to expire on april  30 , 2001 . the proposed waiver would allow qualifying cogenerators to sell  their output above the level at which they have historically supplied this  output to purchasing utility . the waiver for qualifying small power  production facilities in wscc with respect to their fuel use requirements  under ferc regulation section 292 . 204 ( b ) , would be extended to december 31 ,  2001 .  additional capacity from on - site generation  ferc will adopt streamlined regulatory procedure to accommodate wholesale  sales from such facilities that serve load within wscc . through december 31 ,  2001 , owners of generating facilities located at business locations in wscc  and used primarily for back - up or self - generation who would become subject  to fpa by virtue of sales of such power will be permitted to sell power at  wholesale without prior notice under fpa section 205 . ferc also authorizes  such power to be sold at market - based rates . ferc waives its prior notice  requirement for mutually agreed upon interconnection agreements for  interconnections necessary to accomplish these sales . quarterly reporting is  required .  allows demand response bidding  ferc will allow retail customers , as permitted by state law , and wholesale  customers to reduce consumption for the purpose of reselling their load  reduction at wholesale . ferc is granting blanket authorization , consistent  with its prior discussion on sales from on - site generation and requires  similar reporting .  ferc ' s december 15 order on the california market directed , as a longer - term  measure that the iso pursue establishing an integrated day - ahead market in  which all demand and supply bids are addressed in one venue . ferc seeks  comments on the desirability of accelerating action on this .  ferc says it realizes that states play an important role in regulating retail  electric service and that allowing retail load to reduce consumption for  resale in wholesale markets raises legal , commercial , technical and  regulatory issues . safeguards may be needed to protect and enhance retail  demand - response bidding programs . intention is not to undermine state  programs but to promote the necessary complementary wholesale programs .  requests comments on how helpful this action is and how it can be  accomplished consistent with state jurisdiction over retail sales .  contract modifications for demand - response bidding  there may be opportunities for public utilities to make other types of  demand - response arrangements with their wholesale customers . as for mutually  agreeable qf interconnections , ferc will waive prior notice requirement for  any mutually agreeable demand - response related rate schedule amendments that  may be required to effectuate these arrangements . clarifies that  demand - response program costs should be treated consistently with all other  types of incremental and out - of - pocket costs .  interconnections  fpa section 210 ( d ) allows ferc to issue an order requiring interconnection if  it makes a finding that such an order : 1 ) is in the public interest ; 2 ) would  encourage overall conservation of energy or capital , optimize the efficiency  of use of facilities and resources , or improve the reliability of any  electric utility system or federal power marketing agency to which the order  applies ; and 3 ) meets the requirements of fpa section 212 .  ferc requests comments on whether it can use this authority under fpa section  210 ( d ) to alleviate existing impediments to electricity reaching load . if  the exercise of this authority may be warranted , ferc seeks comments on  whether it could make some of the required findings generically for the wscc  region in order to respond quickly should circumstances arise requiring  immediate action .  longer term regional solutions  ferc believes an rto for the entire western region or the seamless  integration of western rtos is the best vehicle for designing and  implementing a long - term regional solution .  natural gas pipeline capacity  ferc has realigned its resources to respond to new applications for gas  pipeline capacity and is soliciting comments on ways to expedite the approval  of pipeline infrastructure needed to serve california and the west . requests  comments on how it might further exercise its authority over new pipeline  construction to alleviate the present crisis , including increasing the dollar  limit thresholds for blanket certificates to $ 10 million , and for prior  notice authorizations to $ 30 million in order to increase the facilities  qualifying for automatic authorization ; offering blanket certificates for  construction or acquisition of portable compressor stations to enhance  pipeline capacity to california ; and offering rate incentives to expedite  construction of projects that will make additional capacity available this  summer on constrained pipeline systems .  hydroelectric power  ferc staff will hold a conference to discuss methods to address environmental  protection at hydro projects while allowing increased generation . requests  comments on ways to allow for greater operating flexibility at  commission - licensed hydro projects while protecting environmental resources .  comments should consider : 1 ) methods for agency involvement ; 2 ) ways to  handle and expedite endangered species act consultations ; 3 ) criteria for  modifying licenses ; and 4 ) identification of processes that could be  implemented to provide efficiency upgrades .  oil pipelines  ferc will explore with oil pipelines innovative proposals that could lead to  ensuring an adequate flow of petroleum product into the california market .  conference with state commissioners  ferc will hold a one - day conference with state commissioners and other state  representatives from western states to discuss price volatility in the west  as well as other ferc - related issues identified by the governors of western  states . by notice issued march 16 , this meeting is scheduled for april 6 ,  2001 in boise , idaho .

i ' m not sure  exactly when i ' ll be going back to houston - but vince has let me know that i  will remain here as long as necessary to ensure adequate daily weather  support for the london traders .  to that end - i think i will need one additional piece of software installed  on the machine that i will be using on a regular basis . could i please get  microsoft frontpage installed as soon as we can get it ?  that leads to the second issue of desks . i know that space is a premium here  - and i understand that i may need to move around some as a result . i  certainly want keep things as simple as possible for everyone - but i also  wanted to make sure that you know that there are certain applications that  are essential for the daily trader support in london and houston . as such ,  if i move , we will need to make sure that these applications are available  from the beginning of the day ( we start about 0600 ) . the applications are :  1 ) adobe acrobat -

that way we would not need to  reinstall this software which could cause problems with the daily support  routine .  thanks again for all of your help . i will let you know - once i know - how  long i will be here . i should hear something from vince over the next few  days giving me an idea .  cheers ,  steve  stephen bennett  senior meteorologist  enron research  temporarily in london : ext 3 -

"Subject: dhabol  jeff ,  we shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from sandeep with the  numbers you have  requested . what follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on  the power situation in india  published by the financial times .  the first article describes recent power outage in northern india affecting  millions of people .  one possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of output lost due  to power  shortages . it is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost  of power produced  by the dhabol plant ( expensive as it may be ) . the power cut affected 230  million people .  the second article is enron specific .  vince  asia - pacific : power failure hits north india  financial times ; jan 3 , 2001  by angus donald  tens of millions of people were left without electricity  in northern india  yesterday after a power grid breakdown .  electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and  most parts of the  capital new delhi , with 60 to 70 per cent of supply  expected to be restored  by the end of the day , according to power grid  officials .  the associated chambers of commerce and industry  ( assocham ) , a  leading business organisation , expressed "" deep concern ""  and called for a  mechanism to prevent future disruption that could  "" cripple the economy "" .  the power failure across eight indian states , including  new delhi , disrupted  train services , water supplies and the telephone network  and forced  hospitals to switch to emergency generators .  the fault occurred on the northern grid , which provides  electricity for 226 m  people , and affected the states of delhi , haryana ,  punjab , uttar pradesh ,  himachal pradesh , madhya pradesh , rajasthan and jammu  and kashmir .  a breakdown at a sub - station in kanpur in uttar pradesh ,  india ' s most  populous state , caused an overload of power on other  lines , which then  failed as well .  trains stopped running for most of the day and signals  systems were  damaged . new delhi international airport was also  slightly affected before  its own power supply could be engaged .  "" we will probe into the reasons for the failure . it is  most likely to be a  technical failure , but we will investigate why it  happened , "" suresh prabhu ,  the power minister , was quoted as saying by press trust  of india .  india suffers regularly from power problems because of  lack of funding to  upgrade infrastructure . theft of supplies is also a big  problem . thirty per  cent of the country ' s electricity is stolen , according  to analysts . in new  delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen .  two years ago , a power failure blacked out uttar pradesh  and delhi for  hours .  assocham issued a statement , saying that increasing  industrial demand  would exacerbate the problems already faced by india ' s  inefficient power  sector . "" the slow progress , particularly in  strengthening the transmission  and distribution system , and ever increasing theft will  contribute to  worsening the power supply situation further .

"" india has lost time and opportunity and has driven  returns down by six  percentage points , "" says gerry grove - white , former india  general manager  of powergen , which has sold its 655 mw plant in gujarat  to china light &  power of hong kong .  india ' s national plan for the five years to 2002 says  generating capacity  must rise by 40 , 000 mw to about 120 , 000 mw . but since  1992 , ipps have  added only 3 , 000 mw and 2 , 500 mw remains under  construction . this is  insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8  per cent economic  growth .  enron was a bellwether of india ' s liberalisation ,  winning fast - track project  approval in the early 1990 s . phase 1 , a 740 mw plant  fuelled by expensive  naphtha came on stream in may 1999 , and phase 2 , a  dollars 1 . 87 bn plant  of 1 , 624 mw capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied  natural gas ( lng ) ,  will be completed this year . only two of seven other  fast - track proposals  have achieved financial closure .  from the outset enron encountered attacks , culminating  in maharashtra ' s  then nationalist government cancelling the project  before renegotiating  terms no less onerous . vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister  of the successor  government , says the power purchase agreement is  unaffordable .  enron , whose attackers also include cultural  chauvinists , wants to maintain  good political relations in a hostile but lucrative  environment . enron views  india as a testing ground for its evolution from a  traditional manager of  power plants to a broad - based trader of commodities ,  such as energy , gas  and bandwidth .  to support these ambitions enron hopes to trade energy  between power  surplus and deficit states , once legislation is passed  this year . it is building  an lng terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural  gas . and it is  laying a 15 , 000 km fibre - optic network to trade bandwidth  space in a country  desperately short of this new economy commodity .  in any event , enron believes it has a watertight  contract . it is supported by  many that believe any subversion of the contract would  confirm investor  perception of maharashtra , india ' s financial and  industrial hub , as an  unreliable destination for investment .  mr deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his  predecessor , which  threatened to "" dump dabhol into the arabian sea "" - is  under pressure from  radical members of his wobbly coalition . but his options  are limited .  scrapping the project would be ruinous for an  economically troubled state  that would have to compensate shareholders .  maharashtra state electricity board , the local utility  and enron ' s main  client , is obliged to dispatch or "" off - take "" 90 per cent  of dabhol ' s output . yet  mseb has never honoured these guarantees . its off - take  has averaged 60  per cent since the plant opened and , in effect , mseb has  been paying a lot  more while consuming a lot less power .  one reason off - take is low is because the state ' s tough  new regulator has  told mseb to buy from cheaper sources . enron says the  tariff would be  rs 4 . 02 / kwh if mseb ' s off - take averaged 90 per cent . but  with off - take a  third lower , the average tariff is rs 4 . 94 per unit , and  often higher . in  october , the tariff was rs 6 . 91 per unit , when off - take  was about 49 per  cent . enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2 ,  run on cheaper  lng , starts .  these cost pressures have forced mseb to take up only  half of a 30 per  cent equity option in phase 2 . enron has acquired the  balance and  mandated bankers to find a buyer .  enron ' s difficulties have undermined the appeal of ipps ,  which have failed to  deliver the flood of investments . potential ipps feared  they would never be  paid by state generating boards that have become a  byword for corrupt  management of power .  reform of state electricity boards , whose uneconomic  pricing means  industrial users subsidise poor farmers , as well as  transmission and  distribution ( t & d ) services to check huge theft and  technical losses , is  overdue .

sandeep with the  numbers you have  requested  what follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on  the power situation in india  published by the financial times   the first article describes recent power outage in northern india affecting  millions of people   one possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of output lost due  to power  shortages  it is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost  of power produced  by the dhabol plant  expensive as it may be   the power cut affected   million people   the second article is enron specific   vince  asia  pacific  power failure hits north india  financial times  jan     by angus donald  tens of millions of people were left without electricity  in northern india  yesterday after a power grid breakdown   electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and  most parts of the  capital new delhi  with  to  per cent of supply  expected to be restored  by the end of the day  according to power grid  officials   the associated chambers of commerce and industry   assocham   a  leading business organisation  expressed  deep concern   and called for a  mechanism to prevent future disruption that could   cripple the economy    the power failure across eight indian states  including  new delhi  disrupted  train services  water supplies and the telephone network  and forced  hospitals to switch to emergency generators   the fault occurred on the northern grid  which provides  electricity for  m  people  and affected the states of delhi  haryana   punjab  uttar pradesh   himachal pradesh  madhya pradesh  rajasthan and jammu  and kashmir   a breakdown at a sub  station in kanpur in uttar pradesh   india  s most  populous state  caused an overload of power on other  lines  which then  failed as well   trains stopped running for most of the day and signals  systems were  damaged  new delhi international airport was also  slightly affected before  its own power supply could be engaged    we will probe into the reasons for the failure  it is  most likely to be a  technical failure  but we will investigate why it  happened   suresh prabhu   the power minister  was quoted as saying by press trust  of india   india suffers regularly from power problems because of  lack of funding to  upgrade infrastructure  theft of supplies is also a big  problem  thirty per  cent of the country  s electricity is stolen  according  to analysts  in new  delhi as much as  per cent is stolen   two years ago  a power failure blacked out uttar pradesh  and delhi for  hours   assocham issued a statement  saying that increasing  industrial demand  would exacerbate the problems already faced by india  s  inefficient power  sector   the slow progress  particularly in  strengthening the transmission  and distribution system  and ever increasing theft will  contribute to  worsening the power supply situation further    copyright  the financial times limited

constant target of  criticism in india  is  hitting back with a campaign to reverse its image as a  profiteering  multinational   its  myth and reality  offensive in local newspapers  follows the west indian  state of maharashtra  s decision to review the tariff it  pays the texas  based  company  whose dollars    bn electricity generating  plant at dabhol is  india  s biggest single foreign investment   maharashtra  s tariff has more than doubled since   and is three times  greater than that charged by other independent power  producers  ipps    the tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the  rupee against the  dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha  fuel  the state also pays  a fixed capacity charge of rs  m  dollars  m  a month   reflecting the  huge project cost and  controversially  irrespective of  consumption   a showdown looks inevitable  reminiscent of a clash six  years ago that  damaged india  s appeal to foreign investors  a former  official of the world  bank  which has criticised the deal  says enron is  emerging  as the east  india company of the  st century   a reference to the  british trader that  colonised key areas of the indian economy in the  th  century   the stand  off is the latest blot on india  s power  sector  the uk  s powergen  and cogentrix of the us have quit india recently   frustrated by long approval

white  former india  general manager  of powergen  which has sold its  mw plant in gujarat  to china light   power of hong kong   india  s national plan for the five years to  says  generating capacity  must rise by    mw to about    mw  but since    ipps have  added only    mw and    mw remains under  construction  this is  insufficient to support official projections of  to   per cent economic  growth   enron was a bellwether of india  s liberalisation   winning fast  track project  approval in the early  s  phase   a  mw plant  fuelled by expensive  naphtha came on stream in may   and phase   a  dollars    bn plant  of    mw capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied  natural gas  lng    will be completed this year  only two of seven other  fast  track proposals  have achieved financial closure   from the outset enron encountered attacks  culminating  in maharashtra  s  then nationalist government cancelling the project  before renegotiating  terms no less onerous  vilasrao deshmukh  chief minister  of the successor  government  says the power purchase agreement is  unaffordable   enron  whose attackers also include cultural  chauvinists  wants to maintain  good political relations in a hostile but lucrative  environment  enron views  india as a testing ground for its evolution from a  traditional manager of  power plants to a broad  based trader of commodities   such as energy  gas  and bandwidth   to support these ambitions enron hopes to trade energy  between power  surplus and deficit states  once legislation is passed  this year  it is building  an lng terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural  gas  and it is  laying a    km fibre  optic network to trade bandwidth  space in a country  desperately short of this new economy commodity   in any event  enron believes it has a watertight  contract  it is supported by  many that believe any subversion of the contract would  confirm investor  perception of maharashtra  india  s financial and  industrial hub  as an  unreliable destination for investment   mr deshmukh  who has avoided the language of his  predecessor  which  threatened to  dump dabhol into the arabian sea   is  under pressure from  radical members of his wobbly coalition  but his options  are limited   scrapping the project would be ruinous for an  economically troubled state  that would have to compensate shareholders   maharashtra state electricity board  the local utility  and enron  s main  client  is obliged to dispatch or  off  take   per cent  of dabhol  s output  yet  mseb has never honoured these guarantees  its off  take  has averaged   per cent since the plant opened and  in effect  mseb has  been paying a lot  more while consuming a lot less power   one reason off  take is low is because the state  s tough  new regulator has  told mseb to buy from cheaper sources  enron says the  tariff would be  rs     kwh if mseb  s off  take averaged  per cent  but  with off  take a  third lower  the average tariff is rs    per unit  and  often higher  in  october  the tariff was rs    per unit  when off  take  was about  per  cent  enron says tariffs should come down when phase    run on cheaper  lng  starts   these cost pressures have forced mseb to take up only  half of a  per  cent equity option in phase   enron has acquired the  balance and  mandated bankers to find a buyer   enron  s difficulties have undermined the appeal of ipps   which have failed to  deliver the flood of investments  potential ipps feared  they would never be  paid by state generating boards that have become a  byword for corrupt  management of power   reform of state electricity boards  whose uneconomic  pricing means  industrial users subsidise poor farmers  as well as  transmission and  distribution  t  d  services to check huge theft and  technical losses  is  overdue   given the limited resources  money would be  better spent on t  d  rather than on new plant   says oliver
