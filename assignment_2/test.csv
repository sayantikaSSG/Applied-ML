"Subject: re : uk power / gas  vince , just fyi :  oliver ( risk control in london ) was asking if it is appropriate to use a set  of factors corresponding to some commodity for another commodity .  this "" mapping "" we do quite frequently in our var system when forward prices  for a commodity are not correlated ( because of poor price history ) .  i think using this kind of mappings is ok because we can not trust these  correlations based on illiquid price information .  if we believed the matrix with low correlations represents what goes on in  the market and we simply can not reconstruct it with our 7 factors - then  we might use more factors then 7 or the matrix itself .  tanya  tanya tamarchenko  12 / 15 / 2000 02 : 36 pm  to : oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect  cc : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron , rudi zipter / hou / ect @ ect , wenyao  jia / hou / ect @ ect , kirstee hewitt / lon / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect ,  naveen andrews / corp / enron @ enron  subject : re : uk power / gas  oliver ,  i completely agree with you : validating var inputs like positions , prices and  volatilities which are used by risktrac is the first thing to do .  you also rise a valid question : if the factor loadings for some commodity do  not make sense should we use the factor loadings for another commodity ?  the factor loadings "" do not make sense "" when the correlations across the term  structure are not high . so if we believe that the forward prices for this  commodity are market prices and statistical analysis on these prices produces  the correlations which we trust , then it would be proper to use this  correlation matrix in var engine , not the factors . using factors is simply  the way to speed up calculations for highly correlated prices without  sacrificing the accuracy .  tanya .  oliver gaylard  12 / 15 / 2000 07 : 11 am  to : naveen andrews / corp / enron @ enron  cc : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron , rudi zipter / hou / ect @ ect , wenyao  jia / hou / ect @ ect , kirstee hewitt / lon / ect @ ect , tanya tamarchenko / hou / ect @ ect ,  ganapathy ramesh / hou / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect  subject : re : uk power / gas  naveen  regarding the calculation of uk vars in risk trac i agree that we should be  using this calculation engine for all commodity vars . however we should not  focus solely on the uk but ensure that we use risk trac for continental power  and gas , uk power and gas , nordic power .  to use risk trac i think the following need to be resolved first , to  implement it "" right the first time "" , as i think it is incorrect to consider  the risk trac numbers "" as the most accurate "" since it depends on the validity  of these items :  positions ( delta and gamma ) and curve mapping - these need to include all  positions including those outside the main risk systems  positions , curves and mapping should now be no problem given the feeds ,  apart from continental power , have been uat ' d and we have the spreadsheet  feeds up and running .  price and vol curves - as used by the risk systems  as above  inter commodity correlation - prompt month  correlation should be easy to calculate given an accurate and complete data  set ( however the incomplete historic data for europe in risk trac , prior to  the formation of the task force , would mean a full data set needs to be  obtained and used ) . term structure of correlation would be good but i  understand this is difficult to use in the calculation .  factor loadings  i think factor loadings should be calculated , on the same data sets used  for inter commodity correlation , for all commodities . if this analysis does  not appear to work i am not sure that using factor loadings for other markets  is adequate . do we need to consider an alternative approach to calculating  var for these markets ?  to ensure this moves forward i think a list of the mile stones ,  responsibilities and time lines needs to be drawn up otherwise i fear the  process of moving across to risk trac from the spreadsheet var will  experience some slippage .  i will call today to start the process off .  rgds  oliver  naveen andrews @ enron  06 / 12 / 2000 21 : 50  to : oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect  cc : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron , rudi zipter / hou / ect @ ect , wenyao  jia / hou / ect @ ect , kirstee hewitt / lon / ect @ ect , tanya tamarchenko / hou / ect @ ect ,  ganapathy ramesh / hou / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect  subject : uk power / gas  oliver ,  i had a couple of issues pertaining to uk power / uk gas . first ,  just a few notes as it pertains to risk trac uk - implementation :  ( 1 ) in risktrac , currently all the gas curves are mapped to nbp .  ( 2 ) all the power curves are mapped to r 4 ( cinergy ) .  factor loading analysis lends itself only to nbp and the norewgian curves ( for  reasons of liquidity , etc ) . we have decided that nbp and cinergy are the  best curves available at this time .  the spreadsheet which is utilized in the uk also has curves mapped to a  2 - 3 - year old set of factors derived from us nat gas , which is clearly not  optimal . hence  ( 1 ) we should be using risktrac numbers for var , as it is the "" most  accurate "" , both in terms of ene - wide model usage and in terms of the most  recent updated data . ever since uk power came on board in risktrac 3 weeks  ago , the uk power number has been consistently 7 - 8 mm above the numbers in  your spreadsheet . this difference is to be ecpected , given the different  inputs .  ( 2 ) the consistent numbers do not point to a data error in any obvious way ,  however , if you believe that positions are not captured correctly , please let  our it staff know that .  ( 3 ) checks which ramesh has done indicate that positions are tying in .  however , as you know , there could be disconnects with enpower , etc .  in any event , it would be ideal and optimal to have all the simulations run  out of risktrac for reasons of aggregation and analysis .  your help is appreciated .  regards  naveen",0

"Subject: business intent  dear sir ,  i am stanley woodwork , the secetary of africa white farmers  co - operation ( awfc ) of zimbabwe . after the last general elections in my country where the incumbent president mr . robert mugabe won the presidential election , the  government has adopted a very aggressive land reforms programme . this programme is solely aimed at taking the land owned by white african farmers for redistribution to black africans . this programme has attracted worldwide  condemnation from world leaders including british prime minister , mr tony blair and also forced several white farmers to flee the country for fear of  victimization and physical abuse .  two weeks ago , our headquartes in harare was attacked and  looted by black protesters and in the process burnt down the whole building . fortunately , they did not get access to the huge funds kept in the strong room which  belong to the co - operation . this cash was kept at the secretariat rather than in the bank for fear of seizure by the government .  now i have the funds in my possession and would need to get it invested in a viable business venture in europe . the cash in question is us $ 46 million dollars .  once i can get your commitment and sincerity of investing  this funds on our behalf then i would proceed to get the funds freighted to europe , where you would be required to pick it up for investment for us .  you do not have anything to worry about as i would undertake all charges involved in freighting the funds to europe , and the business proposal is 100 % legal and risk free .  you would be adequately compensated for all your effort once we have gotten the funds to europe .  please get back to me if you can be of assistance and i would want our correspondence to be via email as most phone lines of white farmers are bugged by the government .  i expect 100 % confidentiality and your prompt response to  this mail so as to proceed . you may also reach me on stanleywoodwork @ email . com  kind regards ,  stanley woodwork .",1

"Subject: re : wall street micro news report  homeland security investments  the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 have  changed  the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and  logical  security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in  the  banking , national resource and government sectors . according to giga ,  a  wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for  information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by  2005 .  homeland security investments is a newsletter dedicated to providing  our  readers with information pertaining to investment opportunities in this  lucrative sector . as we know , events related to homeland security  happen  with lightning speed . what we as investors can do is position  ourselves in  such a way as to take advantage of the current trends and be ready to  capitalize on events which have yet to happen . homeland security  investments is here to help our readers do just that .  with this in mind , it is with great excitement that we present vinoble ,  inc .  this stock is expected to do big things in both the near and long  terms .  symbol : ( vnbl )  current price : 0 . 08  short term target price : 0 . 35  12 month target price : 1 . 20  * * * why we believe vnbl . ob will give big returns on investment * * *  * at this time much of vnbl ' s focus is on rfid ( radio frequency  identification ) technology . this is technology which uses tiny sensors  to  transmit information about a person or object wirelessly .  * vnbl is already an industry pioneer in the rfid personal location  technology .  * vnbl is developing a form of rfid technology which allows companies  and  governments to wirelessly track their assets and resources . such  technology  has huge potential in the protection and transportation of materials  designated "" high risk "" were they to fall into the wrong hands .  * vnbl works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order  to  create "" high security space "" in locales where it is deemed necessary .  locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports , sea  ports ,  mines , nuclear facilities , and more .  * as with all stocks , news drives the short term price . fresh news has  made vnbl a hot buy .  news on vnbl  malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - june 16 , 2005 - - vinoble , inc .  ( otcbb : vnbl -  news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth  opportunities  in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and  other  security services , announced today that it plans to offer products and  services that will assist in the automation of the identification and  control of equipment , assets , tools , and the related processes used in  the  oil & gas and petrochemical industries .  although small wirelessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines  and  equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious , they  can  also deliver safety features within oil wells . oil maybe trapped in  different layers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of  specific  liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise  opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,  such as  a well filling with water .  as with other rf based technology applications , rfid can also provide  the  safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler , and limit the  entry of personnel to specific locations . ensuring personnel safety is  essential , should there be an emergency at a facility , rfid tags would  enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee ' s safety and / or  danger . this application technology requires product and hardware that  can  operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions , but gives  valuable  safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer . rfid  can  also assist the customer ' s supply chain by tracking oil , gas , and  chemical  products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level .  vinoble ' s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are  more  than just a valuable tool to the mining industry , but as a protective  measure of our country ' s natural resources and commodities against  threat .  preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of  u . s .  industry and economy .  the company believes that such offering service and technology  application  in the oil & gas and petrochemical industry will further position  vinoble in  a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the  increasing capital and global spending that the company will require  for  growth . the company ' s goal is to also provide a much - needed service at  a  cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to  do  without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of  constant threat .  this is outstanding news . the growth potential for this company is  exceptional . in an already hot industry , vnbl . ob stands out as a truly  innovative pioneer . we see big things happening to this stock .  information within this email contains "" forward looking statements ""  within the meaning of section 27 a of the securities act of 1933 and  section 21 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 . any statements that  express or involve discussions with respect to predictions ,  expectations , beliefs , plans , projections , objectives , goals ,  assumptions or  future  events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may be  "" forward looking statements .

"Subject: enron net works  it is becoming increasingly clear that the development of ecommerce will have  a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad  array of industries . through enrononline , enron has quickly become a major  catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries .  enrononline has been an enormous success since its launch . since launch , we  have completed 67 , 043 transactions on line , with a total dollar value of over  $ 25 billion . enrononline is now the largest ecommerce site in the world .  we believe that the competitive success of enrononline is due to one very  specific reason . in addition to providing a web - based platform for  transactions , enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the  site . we stand ready at all times , in any market conditions , to buy and sell  at the posted price . this converts a  & bulletin board  8 ( the more typical  ecommerce concept ) into a true market . there are very few , if any ,  competitors that can provide this capability .  we are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be  dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies . if we are  correct , this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for enron .  accordingly , we are initiating a major new effort to capture this  opportunity . effective today we are creating a new business , enron net  works , to pursue new market development opportunities in ecommerce across a  broad range of industries . it is likely that this business will ultimately  be our fifth business segment , joining transmission mike  mcconnell , chief operating officer ; and jeff mcmahon , chief commercial  officer . these individuals will comprise the office of the chairman for  enron net works and remain on the executive committee of enron corp .  replacing greg whalley as president and chief operating officer of enron  north america is dave delainey , who will also join enron  , s executive  committee .  global technology will remain intact but will now be a part of enron net  works . it will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as  an enron global function . philippe bibi will remain the chief technology  officer for all of enron corp . and continues to be responsible for the  development of worldwide technology standards and platforms .  enrononline , headed by louise kitchen , will also remain intact and will now  be a part of enron net works . the success of enrononline enables us to  utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets . in addition , the  following individuals are included in enron net works along with their  current ecommerce initiatives : harry arora , public financial securities ; jay  fitzgerald , new markets identification ; bruce garner , metals ; and greg piper ,  pulp and paper .  over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational  design and will provide full details on this exciting new business  opportunity .",0

"Subject: pricing credit on thousands of names  all -  our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to  provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [ 5 , 000 by year - end ] .  most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information ,  making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of  competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we  plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective .  currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under  development :  fmc model ( default probability approach ) . using bloomberg ' s fair market ( par  yield ) curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then  default / bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology .  fmc model ( credit spread approach ) . using the fmcs , then directly taking the  libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding  differences .  bond model ( fmc approach ) . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model  regresses the input bonds ( specific to a name ) on the two best fitting  benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs ,  but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated  using both spread and probability approaches . under testing .  bond model ( spline approach ) . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer ,  the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve ,  then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing .  market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors / ratings , cds market  prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap  prices .  kmv . using expected default frequencies ( edfs ) from the kmv model and  database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate  risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next .  each of these models returns a price ( credit default and bankruptcy ) , and the  accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory  differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia ,  capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid  names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside  other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing  system .  our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and  market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific ' soft ' data from  credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a  price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the  credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial  information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights .  the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with  market ( or trader ) prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the  weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the  system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid  market prices ( bonds , equities , default swaps ) , where the weightings are  calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc .  the key steps to implementing such a system will be :  establishing what exactly we want to ' predict ' - is it a price , a rating , a  probability , or a score ? we will need a clean market history to calibrate to ,  which we only really have for ratings . we will then need to develop a mapping  from rating / score to price .  getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to  calibrate the model .  building the mechanics of the model , ie , the calibration methodology . neural  nets / fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates , but which exact methods and  software packages to use ?  determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited  information into the model .  getting the "" true "" market price , in order to feed back an error . at present  such a price exists for very few credits .  allocating resources to the development . mckinsey claimed such a system would  take 6 - 10 man - months to develop .  further ideas or comments are requested , as we need to develop our strategy  asap . the model description above is fairly vague , as we don ' t yet have the  knowledge needed to fill in the specific details . further help will be  especially required on this if we are to continue to move at ' internet speed ' .  regards  ben",0

"Subject: a & a math majors  vince ,  thank you so much for meeting with me friday morning about the research  group .  after leaving your office , i remembered an issue i have had with the analyst  & associate program that might be of interest to you .  during a texas a & m recruiting meeting , i learned that we have expanded our  list of majors to include computer science . i wondered why math majors were  not mentioned , and was told that there was not a business need for math  majors . like liberal arts majors , they said math majors were only considered  on a person by person basis . in my opinion , math majors have many of the  same skills as finance majors , and can easily adjust to accounting rotations  as well ( i did last summer , and finance majors in the program are forced to  every year . ) i think that enron is missing out on many qualified candidates  by limiting their recruitment effort .  at texas a & m the career center asks companies for a list of majors they are  targeting , and only allows those majors to sign up for interviews through the  career center . i sent my resume to enron and asked to be included in the  interview process on campus . however , many other math majors had not heard  of enron or the other companies , and assumed that there was no place for a  math major at a company like enron . many math majors want to continue their  education , become teachers , or work for an actuarial firm . however , many  are undecided . we are constantly told of the many business possibilities  available to math majors by our teachers and staff , but many undergraduates  are still not sure exactly what math majors can contribute in a business  environment . by not mentioning math majors to the career center ( a very  simple and inexpensive step ) , enron is losing out on a very talented pool of  people . while it would be nice to get the math majors that knew about enron  already , had thoroughly researched all companies and determined that math  majors would fit perfectly , and went the extra step to send enron their  resume outside the career center system , there are many qualified students  who do not do this , and opt for other companies who did mention math majors .  i called a manager in the a & a program to suggest that we consider at least  mentioning math majors to the career centers . i realize that it may cost  more to actively pursue them , talk to teachers , and attend math society  events . however , i told her that including them at the career center would  be very inexpensive for enron . she reiterated that they saw no business need  for math majors , and that if more upper level people began requesting them ,  it would be considered . i searched for "" mathematics "" on the enron job  website , and had a surprising number of results . i know that your group  could use math majors as well . however , this still may be too small a number  to merit a focus from the a & a recruiting department . i just wanted to bring  it to your attention in case it was something that you felt should be changed .  thanks ,  heather johnson  x 53240",0

"Subject: lng by rail  vince ,  i was thinking about the type of things you could be talking to jeff shankman  about , in the dabhol lng context . it occurred to me that one way to collect  on regas charges , and still find alternate cutomers for gas is through the  railways .  some time back , i had looked into the possiblility of transporting lng by  train . apparently , technology exists wherein lng can be put into cryogenic  containers that can be trucked as well as the same containers being loaded  from trucks to train bogies . i believe this maybe a way to earn some monies  with lng by developing just such a market in india for commercial customers .  it is pertinent to note that the konkan rail line is just about 1 hr . 45  minutes from the dabhol plant . trucks from dabhol could carry lng to the  rail line at guhagar from where it could travel up and down the west coast of  india . if we target end - consumers directly , we could easily sell at retail  type prices , and build in a large margin , even if the volumes disposed are  relatively smaller . ( the alternative fuel for most of these establishments  is diesel or naphtha which is highly priced , and mostly trucked along  roads , increasing costs ) . the end aim is to keep income targets in india , so  that the analysts do not have a field day with the stock .  hence keeping activity up in india , and showing that solutions exist , will  keep stock price buoyed . we could explore this idea if it appeals !  regards ,  sandeep .",0

mail . my phone number is ( 617 ) 492 - 9551 .  i graduated from princeton university in 1996 ( mathematics ) , and came  straight to mit for a  ph . d . in operations management at the sloan schoolof management . in my first  three years i took all the required coursework in mathematics ,  optimization , stochastic processes , etc . , as well as a number of courses in  psychology ( at mit and harvard ) . i am working with prof . gabriel bitran ,  and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations . in  particular , i am interested in the interaction between customers and  companies ( hence the interest in psychology ) . the ( tentative ) title of my  phd thesis is "" pricing substitute products on the internet "" , and i am  sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will  give you an idea of what this research is about .  thanks again , and i ' m looking forward to meeting you and your research  group next week .  paulo  pricing substitute products on the internet  objective :  to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold  on  the internet .  motivation :  this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and  optimization  models are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological  innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of  information  which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices .  furthermore ,  companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can  have access to .  the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue  faced  by internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g .  vcrs  or computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show  different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of  flexibility  was not available until the internet came about .  the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the  methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of  other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are  many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a  given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer  to which customers and how much to charge for these services .  research strategy :  our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components  which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these  components are choice models and optimization models .  choice models :  choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature  draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the  common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic  elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options  based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice  remains .  these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very  easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models  that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological  models .  the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with  these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how  consumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will  be  to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between  customers  and companies on the internet .  optimization :  traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a  certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue  still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term  profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know  your customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must  therefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component  ( learning ) .",0

"Subject: interview - numerical methods & finance  dear tanya :  it was a great pleasure to have met you . i very much enjoyed the interview and your insightfull questions .  i am keenly aware that many of the methods that i discussed with you yesterday are unique , new and not reported elsewhere . this is true both about the work i did in whole yield curve interest rate pricing as well as garch . the innovations stem from the extensive numerical analysis experience that i have both in turbulence physics as well as finance . they entailed considering the problem from its raw formulation , mathematical analysis , physical interpretation , taylored numerical method development , software writting and develoment and data management .  as to why i have not yet published anything the answer is that the driver in my work has been adding value to the business not publishing . publishing is however an option that has always been open with my former supervisor who is aware of the work that i did .  i not however that these results were possible only by exploring to the utmost extent the mathematics , finance , software design and data managemnet aspects of the problem . absence of any of these aspects is likely to cripple performance and execution .  please recall that as good as they were the performance measures that i mentioned to you were for a single processor machine . vastly better can be achieved with both soft parallelism ( multithreading ) as well as hard parallelism ( heterogenous network ) . this fo course allows us to step up the reach of the models used .  in fact i know for a fact that better can be done than what i mentioned in the interview . from work that i have been doing on the integration of the swaption volatility surface on the whole yield curve interest rate model itm and otm instruments can be included in both the callibration , pricing and hedging .  i look forward hearing back from you soon and particularly to the opportunity of us cooperating .  best regards  joao",0

"Subject: dhabol  jeff ,  we shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from sandeep with the  numbers you have  requested . what follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on  the power situation in india  published by the financial times .  the first article describes recent power outage in northern india affecting  millions of people .  one possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of output lost due  to power  shortages . it is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost  of power produced  by the dhabol plant ( expensive as it may be ) . the power cut affected 230  million people .  the second article is enron specific .  vince  asia - pacific : power failure hits north india  financial times ; jan 3 , 2001  by angus donald  tens of millions of people were left without electricity  in northern india  yesterday after a power grid breakdown .  electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and  most parts of the  capital new delhi , with 60 to 70 per cent of supply  expected to be restored  by the end of the day , according to power grid  officials .  the associated chambers of commerce and industry  ( assocham ) , a  leading business organisation , expressed "" deep concern ""  and called for a  mechanism to prevent future disruption that could  "" cripple the economy "" .  the power failure across eight indian states , including  new delhi , disrupted  train services , water supplies and the telephone network  and forced  hospitals to switch to emergency generators .  the fault occurred on the northern grid , which provides  electricity for 226 m  people , and affected the states of delhi , haryana ,  punjab , uttar pradesh ,  himachal pradesh , madhya pradesh , rajasthan and jammu  and kashmir .  a breakdown at a sub - station in kanpur in uttar pradesh ,  india ' s most  populous state , caused an overload of power on other  lines , which then  failed as well .  trains stopped running for most of the day and signals  systems were  damaged . new delhi international airport was also  slightly affected before  its own power supply could be engaged .  "" we will probe into the reasons for the failure . it is  most likely to be a  technical failure , but we will investigate why it  happened , "" suresh prabhu ,  the power minister , was quoted as saying by press trust  of india .  india suffers regularly from power problems because of  lack of funding to  upgrade infrastructure . theft of supplies is also a big  problem . thirty per  cent of the country ' s electricity is stolen , according  to analysts . in new  delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen .  two years ago , a power failure blacked out uttar pradesh  and delhi for  hours .  assocham issued a statement , saying that increasing  industrial demand  would exacerbate the problems already faced by india ' s  inefficient power  sector . "" the slow progress , particularly in  strengthening the transmission  and distribution system , and ever increasing theft will  contribute to  worsening the power supply situation further . ""  copyright : the financial times limited  , copyright the financial times limited 2000 . "" ft "" and "" financial times ""  are trademarks of the financial times . privacy policy | terms jan 3 , 2001  by khozem merchant  enron , the us energy producer and a constant target of  criticism in india , is  hitting back with a campaign to reverse its image as a  profiteering  multinational .  its "" myth and reality "" offensive in local newspapers  follows the west indian  state of maharashtra ' s decision to review the tariff it  pays the texas - based  company , whose dollars 2 . 2 bn electricity generating  plant at dabhol is  india ' s biggest single foreign investment .  maharashtra ' s tariff has more than doubled since 1993  and is three times  greater than that charged by other independent power  producers ( ipps ) .  the tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the  rupee against the  dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha  fuel . the state also pays  a fixed capacity charge of rs 970 m ( dollars 21 m ) a month ,  reflecting the  huge project cost and , controversially , irrespective of  consumption .  a showdown looks inevitable , reminiscent of a clash six  years ago that  damaged india ' s appeal to foreign investors . a former  official of the world  bank , which has criticised the deal , says enron is  emerging "" as the east  india company of the 21 st century "" - a reference to the  british trader that  colonised key areas of the indian economy in the 19 th  century .  the stand - off is the latest blot on india ' s power  sector . the uk ' s powergen  and cogentrix of the us have quit india recently ,  frustrated by long approval  procedures , inadequate payments mechanisms or because of  higher  returns elsewhere .  "" india has lost time and opportunity and has driven  returns down by six  percentage points , "" says gerry grove - white , former india  general manager  of powergen , which has sold its 655 mw plant in gujarat  to china light &  power of hong kong .  india ' s national plan for the five years to 2002 says  generating capacity  must rise by 40 , 000 mw to about 120 , 000 mw . but since  1992 , ipps have  added only 3 , 000 mw and 2 , 500 mw remains under  construction . this is  insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8  per cent economic  growth .  enron was a bellwether of india ' s liberalisation ,  winning fast - track project  approval in the early 1990 s . phase 1 , a 740 mw plant  fuelled by expensive  naphtha came on stream in may 1999 , and phase 2 , a  dollars 1 . 87 bn plant  of 1 , 624 mw capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied  natural gas ( lng ) ,  will be completed this year . only two of seven other  fast - track proposals  have achieved financial closure .  from the outset enron encountered attacks , culminating  in maharashtra ' s  then nationalist government cancelling the project  before renegotiating  terms no less onerous . vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister  of the successor  government , says the power purchase agreement is  unaffordable .  enron , whose attackers also include cultural  chauvinists , wants to maintain  good political relations in a hostile but lucrative  environment . enron views  india as a testing ground for its evolution from a  traditional manager of  power plants to a broad - based trader of commodities ,  such as energy , gas  and bandwidth .  to support these ambitions enron hopes to trade energy  between power  surplus and deficit states , once legislation is passed  this year . it is building  an lng terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural  gas . and it is  laying a 15 , 000 km fibre - optic network to trade bandwidth  space in a country  desperately short of this new economy commodity .  in any event , enron believes it has a watertight  contract . it is supported by  many that believe any subversion of the contract would  confirm investor  perception of maharashtra , india ' s financial and  industrial hub , as an  unreliable destination for investment .  mr deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his  predecessor , which  threatened to "" dump dabhol into the arabian sea "" - is  under pressure from  radical members of his wobbly coalition . but his options  are limited .  scrapping the project would be ruinous for an  economically troubled state  that would have to compensate shareholders .  maharashtra state electricity board , the local utility  and enron ' s main  client , is obliged to dispatch or "" off - take "" 90 per cent  of dabhol ' s output . yet  mseb has never honoured these guarantees . its off - take  has averaged 60  per cent since the plant opened and , in effect , mseb has  been paying a lot  more while consuming a lot less power .  one reason off - take is low is because the state ' s tough  new regulator has  told mseb to buy from cheaper sources . enron says the  tariff would be  rs 4 . 02 / kwh if mseb ' s off - take averaged 90 per cent . but  with off - take a  third lower , the average tariff is rs 4 . 94 per unit , and  often higher . in  october , the tariff was rs 6 . 91 per unit , when off - take  was about 49 per  cent . enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2 ,  run on cheaper  lng , starts .  these cost pressures have forced mseb to take up only  half of a 30 per  cent equity option in phase 2 . enron has acquired the  balance and  mandated bankers to find a buyer .  enron ' s difficulties have undermined the appeal of ipps ,  which have failed to  deliver the flood of investments . potential ipps feared  they would never be  paid by state generating boards that have become a  byword for corrupt  management of power .  reform of state electricity boards , whose uneconomic  pricing means  industrial users subsidise poor farmers , as well as  transmission and  distribution ( t & d ) services to check huge theft and  technical losses , is  overdue . "" given the limited resources , money would be  better spent on t & d  rather than on new plant , "" says oliver blackaby ,  managing director of n m  rothschild in india , which is advising karnataka on the  privatisation of its  distribution network .  for the moment , attention is fixed on enron ' s ability to  satisfy the  competing interests of investors and clients . as sanjay  bhatnagar , chief  executive officer of enron india , said in a recent trade  magazine , one of the  key lessons learned from phase 2 is "" having flexibility  to deal with  externalities "" .  copyright : the financial times limited  , copyright the financial times limited 2000 .

"Subject: eol wti historical trade simulation - more profitable trading  strategy  please ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue , which contains some  typos .  greg and john ,  i found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of  trades ( keeping the  total volume per day constant ) , we can be more profitable . this is partially  because in a trending market  we lose less money by following the market more closely . for example , suppose  market move from  $ 30 to $ 35 . if per trade volume is 10 , 000 bbl and the half bid - offer spread  is $ 1 for simplicity , we take 5  trades of short positions , the total mtm for that day is  ( - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) * 10 , 000 = - $ 150 , 000 and total trading  volume is 50 , 000 bbl short . if per trade volume is 50 , 000 bbl , we take one  trade , the total mtm is  - 5 * 50 , 000 = - $ 250 , 000 . thus the net difference between the two trading  strategies is $ 10 , 000 for that  particular day .  therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the  number of trades , we can be more  profitable as a market maker .  i rerun a scenario that stinson sent to you on dec . 27 where he used per  trade volume of 30 , 000 bbl .  i reduce the number of trade to 10 , 000 while increasing the number of trades  by factor of 3 . almost in all  cases , i saw increased profitability . see the colume marked "" change "" for  dollar amount change in millions .  please let stinson or me know your thoughts on this .  regards ,  zimin lu  x 36388  as compared to",0

"Subject: transport model  andy ,  the scale effect in the transport model can be explained .  i use a european option to do the illustration .  i raise the underlying and strike price by the same amount , use the fuel  percentage to adjust the strike .  the net result is the intrinsic value decreases as the level goes up .  if the fuel percentage is not very high , the option premium actually  increases with the level , although the  intrinsic value decreases .  if the fuel percentage is very high ( > 8 % ) , then we see a decreasing option  price .  in the transport deal , fuel change is often below 5 % , so you will not see a  decreasing spread option price  when nymex moves up . so i think the transport model still does what it  should do .  zimin  in the following exmaple , i used r = 6 % , vol = 20 % , t = 100 days , see spreadsheet  for details .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by zimin lu / hou / ect on 10 / 20 / 2000 01 : 24 pm  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  zimin lu  10 / 20 / 2000 10 : 45 am  to : andrew h lewis / hou / ect @ ect  cc : colleen sullivan / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect  subject : level effect in transport  andy ,  the following spread sheet domenstrates the leve effect in transport  valuation .  i add an "" nymex add - on "" to both delivery and receipt price curve before fuel  adjustment , keep everything else the same . the transport value ( pv of the  spread options )  increases when nymex add - on increases .  i can visit you at your desk if you have further question .  zimin",0

"Subject: re : storage model : simple issues  brad ,  here are my thoughts on your concerns .  * you needs curve inputs . this is an it job . i can help you for the curves  before the system is properly set up .  * intrinsic value vs time value :  the intrinsic value depends on how you allocate the volumes . if you have a  rough idea about the allocation as  you did in the spreadsheet , we can calucate the intrinsic value within the  model . the difference between the  total and the intrinsic will be the ( option ) time value . however , by  pre - allocating volumes , you killed some options .  in the storage model , volumes are allocated dynamically , therefore it is  hard to distinguish the intrinsic vs . time value .  * factor of loading : factor of loadings are used to give historical  correlation matrix . the three factors correspond to  paralle shift , slopping and curveture . the covariance matrix in the model  is expressed in the form  covar = row ( vol _ { i } ) * ( correl ( i , j ) ) * colum ( vol _ { j } ) where vols are  the implied volatilities from the vol curve .  ( correl ( i , j ) ) = l * l ' + residue ( small )  where l is the factor of loading matrix . so in a simple words , the factor of  loadings ( say , 60 x 3 ) are a simplier way for us to  remember the historical correlation matrix ( say , 60 x 60 ) .  let me know if i can offer further help .  zimin  brad horn 02 / 15 / 2000 07 : 15 am  to : zimin lu / hou / ect @ ect  cc : sandra henderson / hou / ect @ ect  subject : storage model : simple issues  zimin :  thanks for your time with the revised storage valuation . your right to  point out the similarity to market bids . here are some basic questions tied  to implementation and calibration :  model infrastructure / it support : i obviously need to re - build my link to the  forward curves as the model is not working in my new location . short - term  ( aprox 1 month ) , i ' d like to establish a link to the ena database egsprod 32  in order to fetch the long - dated price and volatility curves . my link to ena  forward curves would then be quickly severed in favor of the curves generated  by the new bridgeline entity ( database name and data structure yet to be  defined ) . however , its not clear to me what is required in this two stage  process to support your model . any definition of model input or minimum  support requirements you provide is appreciated . i ' ll then work with sandra  henderson , an enron employee providing our it support , to ensure the model  continues to work regardless any downstream system changes that may take  place as we build and establish our separate trading systems or databases .  meanwhile , is there anything you think you can do to ensure im up and running  quickly ?  sandra : linking excel spreadsheets to bridgeline forward curves will be key  to all our pricing projects , not just the storage model supplied by research .  intrinsic vs extrinsic value : it would be helpful to decompose the model ' s  calculated storage price and to distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic ( time or  option ) value . i could easily link a new spreadsheet tab to your model  inputs and to calculate the intrinsic value , and then through a simple  difference i could determine the extrinsic value . ive included a simple  spreadsheet calculation for the intrinsic value for review . i wanted to  share this with you to ask the following :  does the nature of the model define intrinsic and extrinsic value differently  than the simple difference proposed ?  do you think it would make sense to do the simple value decomposition in the  backcode c - code via . dll in order to ensure run - time is faster ?  my goal here is straightforward : a ) to better understand the model and its  sensitivities . ; and b ) to determine if and when the option approach is  associating significant value above and beyond the simple present value of  the time spreads .  factor loadings : what are some of the thoughts or insights you can offer with  regards to factor loadings and how i should interpret the graph of the 3  factors calculated ? factor loadings have always been a mystery to me . for  example , what problems should i be looking for as a warning against  mispricing ? what , if anything , is implied about 1 day price change or  expected curve re - shapings ( after all , curve - reshapings are key to storage  valuation ! ! ! ) ?  calibration : we are preparing a simple summary of descriptive statistics  which should allow me to refine some of the model inputs . i ' ll share the  data when we are and model results once im up and running .",0

 hope you are well .  ?  we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and  you kindly offered that you would provide this . ? is this still possible ? ? we  realise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ahead and wrote  something , which is below , and if you want to review , change or re - write ? the  preface , that would be very appreciated . ? let me know what your thoughts are .  ?  thanks ,  julie  ( we ' re getting close )  ?  ?  preface  ?  ?  ?  one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk  management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for  the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible , to discuss  in - depth the models , and to show how they relate to each other . ? in this  way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide  range of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses  a consistent modelling framework . ? we believe that for practitioners this  last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving  arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent  models for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose  consistent models ? ) . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one  particular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we  believe that the choice should rest with the user ( although it will probably  be clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we prefer ) . ? we therefore try and  give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all  the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models  which best suit their needs .  ?  in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model  and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ?  in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout  the book .  ?  in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that  can be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of  geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility  and jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated  and their parameters estimated .  ?  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ?  this chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods ,  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different  pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and  electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative  aspects of calculating volatility .  ?  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such  curves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial  markets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well  defined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy  prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we  outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building  forward curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric  approach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic  factors .  ?  chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options , and ladder options .  ?  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the  models in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience  yield and interest rate model .  ?  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and  american style options .  ?  chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach  results in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the  evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined  volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form  solutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient  monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter  closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options .  ?  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ?  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the  problem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a  portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging  )  illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the  general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor  hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  ?  chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . ? we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma ,  historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same  portfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the  var estimates for various underlying energy market variables .  ?  finally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we  look in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan  ( 1997 ) ) and creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial products ( 1997 ) ) for which  detailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an  extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present  numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives .  ?  before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of  how both the  + tool  , and the market works . ? the techniques we describe are  certainly not  & magic wands  8 which can be waved at data and risk management  problems to provide instant and perfect solutions . ? to quote from the  riskmetrics technical document  &  ( no amount of sophisticated analytics will  replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk .  8 . ? however ,  the right tools , correctly used make the job a lot easier !",0

"Subject: re : pre - submitted question on espeak  erin ,  a book by martha amram and nalin kulatilaka is an excellent  non - technical introduction to real options and it contains all the most  important  references to more advanced books and papers .  the book has an endorsement by jeff skilling on the cover page .  the research group offered several one - day seminars on real options  and applications to the energy industry . we still have a few binders with  the presentation materials available if you are interested .  we plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall .  the first part of the seminar ( about 4 hours in the morning ) covers general  concept of real options  and their applicability to the energy business .  the second , more technical afternoon session , covers stochastic processes used  to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case  studies ( valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas - fired  power plants ) .  the real options approach has been developed specifically to address the  problem of making  investment decisions under uncertainty . nobody in this field claims that this  is a  perfect tool , but it represents a significant progress compared to other  techniques developed  earlier .  discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through  analysis of several , in most cases , arbitrary scenarios ( most likely ,  optimistic ,  pessimistic ) . these scenarios don ' t identify explicitly the risk drivers  and don ' t specify the future proactive management decisions .  the real , option approach is very powerful because it allows to ( 1 ) capture  uncertainty in an explicit way and ( 2 ) to design investment projects that  allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to  downside risk .  this approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and  future  operational decisions . forward - looking investment decisions create options  that are exercised  in the future through active management of a project .  the real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to  come  up with the representation of future possible states of the world . the real  challenge is  to use these tools in a sensible way . i have seen in my career ( almost 30  years  of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems ) many quants  armed with  powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers . the  challenge is not  to run mechanically thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions  but to translate in a creative way the insights of people who understand  specific businesses  into parsimonious quantitative models . it is especially critical to  stress - test the assumptions  of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends  critically on any set of assumptions .  if this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying  assumptions .  i remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the  dynamics of oil prices ,  but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very  optimistic upward trend .  one would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question  what economics 101  teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand .  enron north america corp .  from : erin rice @ enron 06 / 27 / 2000 03 : 52 pm  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : pre - submitted question on espeak  good news ! there is already a question waiting for your july 12 espeak  session . i have pasted it below , although you don ' t have to respond until  the actual event . don ' t forget to send a bulleted list of discussion topics  if you would still like us to advertise the event on the elevator screens .  thanks .  - er  submitted by breineck  i was doing some reading about the application of real options in the  evaluation of non - financial assets . would you recommend any texts or articles  for a  more in - depth study of this area ? is quantification of risk or uncertainty  the major challenge in using this concept ? can statistical tools be used with  this to do  a sort of sensitivity analysis ?",0

"Subject: comments  hi sheridan ,  how are you ? i hope that you had a good vacation . vasant and i looked at  your memo and found it to be interesting . i shall first briefly summarize  our understanding of the methodology you propose . the comments follow .  finally , i shall sketch a simple gas field project you can use as a test case  in further refining the model .  it appears that you are proposing a state - space approach where probabilities  of different states at various future dates are specified . the next step is  to assume a discount rate and to compute the present value by following the  branches from the origin to one of the terminal points . traversing through  the tree in this manner over many iterations will permit us to compute the  average present value of the project . also , you are using the simulation to  assign a value of the project to each node . thus each node will have a cash  flow associated with it which will occur if the node is reached and a value  which is an expectation of the value to be realized going forward . if some  of these values turn out to be negative , zero - coupon , risk - free bonds are  purchased to neutralize the negative realization .  next , we find a comparable and apply the expected rate of return back to our  project ( based on the variance of the returns ) . we iterate until  convergence .  finally , we subtract the initial investment and the computed risk capital  from the pv of the gross cash flows ( including debt ) to determine if the  project merits further consideration .  comments / clarifications  1 . the money is being set aside to avoid negative values . it is not clear  if you mean the values of the cash flow or the pv at the node . anyhow , we  shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes at  that cross - section of time as the risk - free asset pays in all states of  nature . this will have to be done every time there is a negative  realization . thus , for the typical project we have , the value of risk  capital may be extremely high , as we are not following a tail - based norm  anymore .  2 . your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all  values being positive . if so , we are only issuing risk - free debt . also , a  project with a single negative value at each cross - section of time will not  have a positive debt capacity .  3 . it seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate , which is  obtained in each step from the comparison investment ( by equating the  variances ) . it is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such an  effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence . also ,  our project has a finite life and the market - based assets will have infinite  lives . in the light of this fact , how will we define the relevant variance ?  is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison investment ?  4 . finally , our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the investment  and also the risk capital . setting risk capital to zero , this model closely  resembles the intuitive present value criterion and endogenously determines  the discount rate .  gas field case  to facilitate your thinking , we are providing a gas field example below .  we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field . a profile of  expected production and variance of the production per year is available from  the engineers at the beginning . production will be autocorrelated , as the  profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being more or  less than the estimated reserves . we assume the life of the field to be 10  years with no salvage value . there are fixed and variable operating costs .  it might be useful for you to think about applying the framework to this  problem .  do let me know if you have further questions .  rakesh",0

"" the government , way back in 1995 , has  modified the sales tax rate to 4 per cent to discourage the import of naphtha  from gujarat by electrical companies operating in maharashtra . the decision  was taken with a view to encouraging electrical companies to procure naphtha  at reduced rates within the state , "" government sources added . sources said  that these companies had to pay nearly 15 . 3 per cent sales tax on naphtha  that was procured from gujarat . however , following their representation , the  government slashed the sales tax rate to 4 per cent .  the state finance department ' s opinion , which would be presented before the  state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision , deserves special  significance especially when the state energy department and the loss - making  maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) have wholeheartedly supported the  dpc ' s cause and recommended the sales tax waiver . dpc , which was asked by the  union ministry of oil and petroleum to procure naphtha within the country in  view of excess availability , in its presentation to the state government and  to mseb , had made it clear that it would be left with no alternative but to  pass on the additional burden on the mseb which would be ultimately passed on  to its consumers . dpc had also told the state government that it had not paid  sales tax on the procurement of naphtha from glencore in the calender year  2000 .  sources from the state energy department and mseb have stressed on the need  for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burden .  they have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sales tax  exemption to dpc because the ioc , at the behest of the centre , has tried to  match the international landing price of naphtha during the recently signed  memorandum of agreement with dpc . "" if the state finance department sticks to  its views , it may hurt the state as a whole , "" sources from the state energy  department and mseb said . dpc will procure naphtha at rs 11 , 050 per ton from  ioc during the calender year 2001 as compared to the rs 10 , 050 per tonne  price quoted by glencore . the naphtha price comprises $ 175 per tonne free on  board ( fob ) , 21 . 8 per cent of customs duty , 5 . 4 per cent of sales tax and  $ 18 . 87 of premium .  dpc senior vice president mukesh tyagi reiterated that the company has  already made an appeal to the state government for the sales tax waiver on  naphtha in the larger interest of the consumers . "" sales tax is a pass through  and mseb , which will have to bear the additional burden , will pass it on the  consumers , "" he added .  - - - - - - -  centre yet to receive proposal on enron  thursday jan 18 2001  centre on wednesday said that it had not recevied any proposal from  maharashtra government seeking help to solve the tangle with the enron  promoted dhabol power project relating to cost and surplus power . asked about  the reports that maharashtra government was sending a proposal that centre  buy surplus power from dhabol power company through power trading  corporation , power minister suresh prabhu said "" we have not received any  proposal . "" "" we are carefully watching the situation and will await a concrete  proposal before intervening in this matter , "" parbhu said on the sidelines of  greentech environment excellence awards ceremony , here . asked whether there  was any possibility of the government asking the power trading corporation to  buy power from the dhabol power corporation , prabhu replied "" what will the  ptc do with the power ? ""  prabhu had earlier asked the state government to study the matter before  approaching the centre for payment of dues . mseb had earlier declined to pick  up its 15 per cent stake in phase ii of the 1444 mw project . the enron issue  has been hanging fire with the maharashtra state electricity board unable to  clear the dues of dpc as a result of the skyrocketing prices of naphtha  infact mseb has asked dpc to backdown completely leading to a situation where  dpc has stopped production at the facility from the begining of the  month . state government has stepped in with support to the tune of rs 114  crore to enable mseb to clear the dues for october . mseb dues to dpc for  november and december amount to over rs 300 crores .",0

"Subject: alliance info alert : richardson and ferc orders  dear generation / power marketing executive :  the following are summaries of two significant activities that occurred  friday , december 15  1 . energy secretary richardson issuance of an emergency order .  ( richardson ' s statement and fpa section 202 ( c ) order is posted on doe ' s  web site at :  http : / / www . energy . gov / hqpress / releaseso 0 / decpr / pro 0309 . html )  2 . ferc ' s 12 / 15 / 00 final order to fix california wholesale markets  ( ferc ' s order can be viewed at  california supplies ordered by richardson  o richardson orders listed entities to supply excess power to california iso  o order is effective as soon as iso certifies shortage , but ends 12 / 21 / 00 ,  unless extended  o prices to be agreed to by supplier and iso , or ferc will set rate later  o fpa emergency power authority transferred to doe in 1977  as he said he would on december 13 , u . s . department of energy secretary bill  richardson found "" an emergency exists in california by reason of the shortage  of electric energy "" and issued an emergency order under section 202 ( c ) of  the federal power act ( fpa ) requiring listed generators and marketers to  provide any power in excess of the needs of their firm customers to the  california iso . in a statement , richardson said the threat to the  reliability of the california grid requires a long - term solution , but that in  the short - term power must keep flowing to the state to avert blackouts .  the 76 listed suppliers have 12 hours after the iso certifies to doe that it  has been unable to acquire adequate supplies in the market to begin providing  requested service to the iso . the iso must inform each supplier subject to  the order of the amount and type of energy or services required by 9 : 00 pm ,  eastern standard time , the day before the services are needed . the order  directs the iso to allocate , to the extent feasible , requested services among  subject entities in proportion to each supplier ' s available excess power .  the order is effective immediately and will terminate at 3 : 00 am , eastern  time , december 21 , 2000 , unless extended . to continue to obtain supplies  under this emergency authority , the iso must re - certify the shortage to doe  headquarters every 24 hours .  the terms of the provision of electric energy and other services by suppliers  to the iso "" are to be agreed to by the parties . "" if no agreement is reached ,  then under the fpa ' s emergency authority secretary richardson "" will  immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to  the federal energy regulatory commission for a determination at a later date  by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures , and will  prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and  reasonable . "" the authority of ferc to set rates for power supplied under  emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do  not agree to a rate is explicitly included in fpa section 202 ( c ) . the doe  organization act of 1997 transferred the emergency powers of this section  from ferc to doe .  the 76 entities identified in the order ' s attachment are all the entities  that have provided power to the iso over the last 30 days . those entities  are ordered "" to make arrangements to generate , deliver , interchange , and  transmit electric energy when , as , and in such amounts as may be requested by  the "" iso , "" acting as agent for and on behalf of scheduling coordinators . ""  [ source : doe secretary richardson ' s december 14 , 2000 statement and order ;  electric power daily , december 15 , 2000 ]  ferc de - federalizes california markets , adopts other structural  reforms  a summary of the december 15 order and commission discussion  at its special meeting today , ferc unanimously approved its eagerly awaited  final order reforming the california wholesale markets , adopting the major  outlines of its november 1 proposed order and sending back to california the  responsibility for addressing state - related matters , as discussed below . at  the same time , ferc deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as  well as the imposition of region - wide price caps .  ferc reiterated the november 1 conclusions that under certain circumstances ,  california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates  due to california ' s "" seriously flawed "" market structure and rules in  conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the west .  while all four commissioners supported the order as a consensus - based outcome  that appropriately balanced all competing interests , each commissioner  expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order . chairman  hoecker and comm . breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement , while comms .  hebert and massey laid out their positions where they believed the commission  had either "" over - reached "" or not gone far enough , just as they did on  november 1 , as discussed below .  highlights of key actions :  ( 1 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to eliminate , effective immediately ,  the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s investor - owned utilities  buy and sell electricity through the px , and allow these utilities to  purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative  mechanisms to manage supply risks . ferc terminated the px ' s rate schedules  effective at the close of business on april 30 , 2001 . in effect , as chairman  hoecker stated , the order de - federalizes 60 percent of the california  wholesale market established under the state ' s restructuring law , returning  ratemaking authority over company - owned generation to the california public  utilities commission ( cpuc ) .  ( 2 ) ferc modified the effective period of the november 1 $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap ""  proposal , limiting its application through april 2001 , whereupon a  "" comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which  incorporates appropriate thresholds , screen and mitigation measures "" must be  in place . in a related move , ferc ordered a technical conference early next  year to develop such a program by march 1 , 2001 , so that these measures can  be place by the may 1 , deadline .  in a major modification , ferc revised the refund conditions to clarify that  while certain refund conditions will continue to apply , unless ferc issues  written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under  review , refund potential on a transaction will close after 60 days .  as proposed , however , supply bids in excess of $ 150 will be prohibited from  setting the market - clearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above  $ 150 / mwh will be required to report their bids to ferc on a confidential ,  weekly basis and provide certain cost support .  ( 3 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require the establishment of  independent , non - stakeholder governing board for the iso . the iso governing  board must relinquish their decision - making power and operating control to  the iso management on january 29 , 2001 . a future order will set procedures  for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process .  ( 4 ) in a major modification , ferc adopted a $ 74 / mwh "" price benchmark "" for  assessing prices of five - year energy supply contracts . this benchmark will  be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of  pricing long - term contracts .  to facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable  rates , ferc announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market  participants .  ( 5 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require market participants to  schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day - ahead market and  instituting a penalty charge for under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent  of hourly load requirements ) , in order to discourage over - reliance on the  real - time spot market .  ( 6 ) ferc directed the iso and the three investor - owned utilities to file  generation interconnection standards .  ( 7 ) ferc affirmed the longer - term measures proposed in the november 1 order ,  including submission of a congestion management design proposal by april 2 ,  2001 .  ( 8 ) ferc deferred resolving key issues , including establishing new iso board  selection procedures , developing appropriate market monitoring measures and  negotiating protective orders associated with data collection .  ( 9 ) ferc reiterated its november 1 call to california policy makers there to  resolve state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability  of day ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand  responses ; ( 3 ) siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of  sufficient reserve requirements .  commissioner responses  comm . hebert reluctantly concurred , calling the final order a "" missed  opportunity "" to , among other things , send appropriate signals for new  generation siting and conservation . reiterating his november 1 concerns ,  hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the commission  should and should not have adopted . while expressing pleasure at the tone of  the order ( "" balanced and considerate "" ) , the bid certainly reversal , and the  role reserved for the state in the selection of the new iso board , hebert  nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order , which  he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low . hebert faulted the commission  for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the november 8 order  approving the ca iso ' s emergency $ 250 / mwh "" soft cap "" proposal . hebert ended  by challenging the cpuc to do what it can to encourage utilities there to  forward contract , including easing the existing prudence review requirements .  comm . breathitt endorsed the order , reiterating her support for progress  towards open and competitive markets . she noted that the order properly  "" walked the line "" by taking all of the competing interests into account ,  calling it less than ideal , but a step in the right direction . she also  concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will  be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of  the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint . additionally she mentioned that any price below the  $ 74 / mwh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable .  comm . massey concurred , but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for  california ratepayers , stating that he felt that market power had been  exercised , that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers  had profited too much at the expense of others in the market . he warned  that , as he understood the legal precedents , the federal courts were poised  to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on  to consumers . on the positive side , he approved of the de - federalization of  60 % of the market and the creation of long term contracts . however , he  emphasized that california regulators must now take the responsibility of  creating more generation and transmission . in the long term , comm . massey  hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference  and that the market would have rules more like pjm .  finally , comm . massey articulated what he would have liked to have done  differently . he stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not  enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the  on - going investigation . he also disagreed with the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint ,  preferring instead a hard price per generator . the commissioner said he  would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and  that he would have opened a section 206 investigation in the west . finally ,  he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds .  chairman hoecker began his comments by saying that the commission was forced  to act and act quickly because the stakes are so high . he feels that it is  now time for the state regulators and markets to act . he noted that by  shrinking the cal px , the responsibility is now with the cpuc to fashion the  long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the  least amount of damage to the utilities . in regards to suggestions for a  regional price cap , the chairman stated that this would not work due to the  fact that the commission has no jurisdiction over bonneville , wapa and the  public power producers and that there is no spot market in the northwest .  however , he did urge secretary richardson to convene a conference in order to  address regional issues . finally , in conceptually addressing the california  situation , the chairman stated that competition or "" deregulation "" did not  fail in california , but that there never was competition in california .",0

"Subject: managing enron ' s relationships with the universities  jeff ,  i would like to get on your calendar ( together with jeff shankman ) for 15 -  30 minutes  to discuss the results of my visit at the wharton school with tom piazze .  a separate message about this visit will follow .  i would like also to talk to you about the way we manage our relationships  with  different universities . historically , we were rather passive customers of  the academic institutions , trying to hire the best students and limiting our  presence  on the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions .  we should rethink the way we work with universities . the efforts to get  the best students look more and more like a hand - to - hand combat and often we  are not  very successful . it is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses  and this can be accomplished in a number of different ways :  1 . involvement in research projects . for example , we are currently  underwriting two research  projects at stanford university , involving ph . d . students of professor  nicholas bambos  ( a top expert on communications networks ) . we shall participate in formulation  of the projects ' objectives and will be given access to the results .  involvement in research projects allows us to obtain  access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and  also to lock - up some very  promising students . most companies in the high tech industries have such  programs .  2 . lectures and presentations by enron employees . practically every  presentation  i have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes  and hiring decisions .  it is important that students get exposed to enron early in their academic  program . in many cases ,  the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach  them during their  senior years .  3 . visits by faculty members in enron .  closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to  getting the best students  and obtaining access to current research . the universities are very important  in shaping public opinion  on the issues critical to enron ' s future ( especially in the area of  deregulation and design of new markets ) .  currently , the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on  personal commitment of a number  of overworked enron employees . in many cases , there is no continuity and  focus .  i want to recommend a creation of a special function ( vp or md level )  responsible for coordinating  our relationships with the universities . this function would be separate from  our analyst / associate  program . i have many ideas how this function could be structured .  vince",0

[ fyi - wasserstein was the investment banker that  handled the recent sale of the market hub partners storage facilities , so  they certainly would have a current list of interested parties . ]  unfortuneately , we will now have to participate in another "" auction "" if we  are to pursue this further . i ' ll let you know what we decide to do .  alaska / northern canada pipeline - i would like to discuss ways that enron  might enhance our prospect of participating in the initiative to bring  substantial new gas reserves from alaska and northern canada to the lower  48 . a large equity investment in a very expensive , regulated pipeline is not  likely to get much support within enron . instead , our competitive advantage  may best be realized through the efficient and creative utilization of the  existing us pipeline grid , ( "" backhaul "" on northern natural , expansion  opportunities on northern border and nng , or even capacity exchanges with  other pipeline operators ) .  i think it would be very useful if we had the capability to model the impact  of the evolving north american marketplace on that initiative , and vice  versa . any insight we could develop on who will be the eventual "" winners ""  and "" losers "" if / when that large volume of new gas enters the market would  be valuable .  i will look forward to our discussion tomorrow ( thursday ) at 1 : 30 pm .  regards , jng",0

"Subject: important information about united healthcare - please read !  to : houston area employees participating in the domestic medical plan benefits  you may have recently received communication from united healthcare ( uhc )  concerning memorial hermann health systems ' ( mhhs ) decision to terminate  their contract with uhc in the houston / beaumont area . this communication  also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network  due to this action . it is our intent to help you understand the situation .  it is our understanding that memorial herman health systems asked for a 40 %  increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to  you and enron ! when united healthcare attempted to negotiate with a counter  proposal , memorial hermann cancelled their contract .  while this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and uhc ,  enron continues to support uhc in their ongoing contract negotiation  efforts . at this time , it is only uhc which has been affected , however , it  is our understanding that cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group  and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well .  many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals  within the uhc network or have contracted directly with uhc including those  with admission privileges to the woodlands , sugarland and clear lake  hospitals , to name a few . in a further effort to limit disruption to our  affected employees and families who are enrolled in the uhc network or epo  options , enron has authorized uhc to process claims incurred between  september 28 and december 31 , 2000 as if the termination of the memorial  hermann health systems from the network had not occurred and in - network  benefits applied . office visits will have a $ 10 copayment and all other  charges will be covered at 90 % . hospital admissions will still need to be  pre - certified with uhc .  these steps have decreased the number of participants ' affected by primary  care physician disruption from 1 , 050 to 127 .  if you need medical attention : you or your doctor / hospital must call uhc ' s  customer service number so proper benefits can be verified . in some cases  the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed .  if this should happen , please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to  uhc with a claim form for prompt reimbursement . claim forms can be obtained  by calling 1 - 800 - 332 - 7979 or in houston at 713 - 853 - 7979 ( press 1 ) .  open enrollment materials will be coming soon . take this opportunity to  consider your elections for 2001 .  united healthcare and enron hr are committed to assisting enron employees  through this transition . we will communicate any further developments that  may impact you or your family .",0

it doesn ' t exist . there ' s nothing there  to fear to begin with . . . get over it ! !  what i ' m telling you is , the only thing standing between  you and the success you most desire . . . is yourself .  when you realize this , you will tear down that brick  wall by means of complete and instantaneous  disintegration . it will no longer exist * in your mind * ,  which is the only "" real "" place it ever was anyhow !  yes , "" persistence and personality "" inherently includes  honesty , integrity , accountability , and many other  qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate  goals and realize that probably the most valuable ,  powerful key to your success . . . is you !  that may be the most incredible "" secret "" we ever  uncover in our lifetime ! and , trust me , that brick wall  won ' t ever get in your way again . . . unless you let it .  talk about simple ! !  bryan is a "" veteran "" internet consultant , author ,  internet success strategist & marketer . he publishes  mega - success . com chronicles to over 11 , 500 subscribing  members , authors articles which appear all over the  net , and helps hundreds of wealth - hungry people in  their journey to internet success .  bryan is also director of his no bs guerrilla internet  marketing group at http : / / . com  & a fantastic new joint venture partners program  for that site .  bryan hall is a founding member and the development  consultant for the prestigious icop ( tm ) at  http : / / www . i - cop . org / 1016 . htm  you can reach bryan at 877 . 230 . 3267 or by  emailing him directly at bryan . hall @ mega - success . com  = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - =  member showcase  = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - =  examine carefully - those with email addresses included will  trade links with you . . . you are encouraged to contact them .  there are many ways to build a successful business - just look at  these successful sites programs other members are involved  in . . .  get insane amounts of traffic to your website .  purchase 10 , 000 guaranteed visitors to your site  and receive 5 , 000 free . more traffic = more money !  less than 2 cents a visitor . space is limited .  order now ! http : / / www . freepicklotto . com  trade links - businessopps @ aol . com  stop smoking - free lesson ! !  discover the secret to stopping smoking .  to master these powerful techniques , come to  http : / / www . breath - of - life . net  for your free lesson .  act now ! p . s . tell someone you care about .  trade links - jturco 3 @ hotmail . com  celebration sale !  $ 99 . 00 on casinos / sportsbetting sites , lingerie stores ,  gift stores , adult sites toy stores .  mention ad # bmlm 99 to receive this special sale price .  order now !  http : / / www . cyberopps . com / ?

"Subject: re : synfuel option valuation  lenny ,  i believe that you must have done your home work on the the tax credit  issue . however , it may  make sense to create some kind of reserve in case the tax credit is removed  in the future .  i am glad that you like the way we treat the tax credit , which is built into  the strike price for the  digital option . with the tax credit , it is most likely the option will be  exercised .  paulo issler is the person who worked on this model initially . he will be  back this wednesday .  we can talk to him about the standard deviation he put into the model .  zimin  lenny hochschild @ enron  02 / 12 / 2001 08 : 15 am  to : zimin lu / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : re : synfuel option valuation  zimin ,  thanks for your e - mail . sorry for the late reply , i was travelling last week .  i ' m under the impression that the with the new administration , there is a  greater chance that section 29 will be extended beyond 2007 than repealed . if  this happens , we contractually have the right to extend this contract . we  have not valued the chance of this happening , so i don ' t think we should  value the chance of this not happening .  anyways , let me speak to my supervisor on this and revert .  in the meantime , i looked over the amendment you made with regard to adding  the second strike of the tax credit and think this is now reflective of the  deal and am happy with it . i still do not understand a few things re : where  did the st . deviations come from . i believe you said that someone who works  for you put this together but was away last week .  please revert with his / her name so that i can get together and understand  this .  thanks .  lenny  zimin lu @ ect  02 / 06 / 2001 01 : 09 pm  to : lenny hochschild / na / enron @ enron  cc : eric groves / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect  subject : synfuel option valuation  lenny ,  i think we had a good discussion about the deal valuation .  one thing , i think you are prefectly aware of it , is that the economics  of this deal is driven by the tax credit ( $ 25 . 03 ) . the risk on our side  is that if the tax credit is removed , aig will not deliver the synfuel  and pay $ 4 . 55 to us .  vince mentioned that congress might act quickly enough to eliminate  the tax benefit . i just want to remind you we should take this risk  into consideration .  zimin  ps :  i changed the results in sheetl slightly . the values in column a was shifted  by 0 . 5 . use the attached model .",0

"Subject: precious metals var  jason ,  after our brief discussion last night i think i should discuss a few of the  issues i have with respect to calculating a var on the deal that you are  proposing . the var model , as i illustrated , is set up to accept a term  structure of delta positions , prices and vols and it may be difficult to  translate the ' silver mine ' position into these inputs .  i do not think that we can simply take the net silver content of the mine and  then make some assumptions about vol and price . the var model  also assumes a certain amount of liquidity in the market and a 1 day holding  period .  to do this properly i would need to understand fully how the deal is priced  as these sensitivities are ultimately what will effect the change in mtm  in the future and that is essentially what var is supposed to predict .  if you need me to work on this then you need to contact steve who will help  to prioritise my time . i will also need to consult with vince kaminski and  tanya tamarachenko in houston for advice .  rac will also assist in the process .  please contact me if you have any further questions ,  kirstee  x 34529",0

"Subject: capital book  to further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing enron america ' s velocity of capital and associated return on invested capital , we have decided to create a capital book . the capital book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by joe deffner . the purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within enron americas , with any form of capital requirement , are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge .  the previous numbers used in the business plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets . therefore , on any assets currently held within each business area , the capital charge will remain at 15 % . internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating business unit subject to the internal ownership policy outlined below .  the cost of capital associated with all transactions in enron americas will be set by joe . this process is separate and apart from the current rac process for transactions which will continue unchanged .  capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15 % . transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15 % across the board charge . transactions which are structured off balance sheet , but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on enron america ' s overall credit capacity .  on transactions that deploy capital through the trading books , the capital book will take a finance reserve on each transaction , similar to the way the credit group takes a credit reserve . this finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction . as noted above , the capital book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost .  by sending market - based capital pricing signals internally , enron america ' s sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization .  questions regarding the capital book can be addressed to :  joe deffner 853 - 7117  alan quaintance 345 - 7731",0

"Subject: industry giants can ' t match this opportunity  another ground breaking news alert from rlyc .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  one company is quickly entering a $ 2 trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi - national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching . in just a few months , this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long - term customers that could generate tremendous re - occurring revenues for many years to come .  although you have probably never heard of this company , you may soon hear of it even if you don ' t continue reading this message . that ' s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u . s . within the next year .  an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry  in reality , this company ' s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you . since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don ' t know this company or what they plan to accomplish , their stock is trading at rock bottom prices . but , if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years , this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments .  the company that we ' ll introduce you to today is ( relay capital corp . pink sheets : rlyc ) . rlyc , which recently went public , is a multi - faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market . rlyc ' s present product and service offerings include pre - paid stored - value cards , reward cards , employee payroll cards , gift , retail and affinity group cards , travel cards and funds transfer cards . these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally .  just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn ' t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner . in order to be successful , that company also needs to be truly innovative , have very strong partners , be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality . rlyc appears to be that company .  below we ' ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  stored - value cards have the potential to help the 50 million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e - commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities . the implications reverberate across industry segments . estimates suggest stored - value transactions could exceed $ 2 trillion in just a few years .  rlyc ' s focus is on providing stored - value cards to the un - banked and under - banked . these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account , debit card . the size of that group is staggering that ' s about one - third of the nation ' s work force !  rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored - value card programs that make it easy , fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored - value cards as well as for the un - banked and under - banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards .  but that ' s not all . the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships . in this segment , relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer . who wouldn ' t want that ? the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc  for the under - and un - banked , collecting their pay , cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming . rlyc ' s stored - value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem .  rlyc ' s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un - banked alike ! lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u . s . cards , cards in foreign countries , and services bought through the cards , improved employee retention , improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc . various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system , while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or 24 hour access to their money through atms .  rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards  earlier this year , rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc ( click to go to their site ) , a leader in providing technical , craft and administrative staffing services to businesses , industry and government through locations in houston , dallas , long island , orlando , phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un - and under - banked populations .  the potential market for this service is really big . it includes large employers , companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers .  this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing , cutting , and mailing paper payroll checks . it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay , eliminate lost checks , stop payments and minimize fraud . but best of all , this should help to significantly boost rlyc ' s revenues .  $ 150 billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries  mexicans in u . s . send $ 16 . 3 billion a year back to mexico  with $ 150 billion being transferred internationally each year , remittances are a really big business . in times past , people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices . many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union . more recently , more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances .  the problems with traditional money transfer methods  with wire services , there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas . first , wiring funds across borders can be expensive . this can make it very cost - prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service . next there is the problem of logistics . both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company ' s services . even if they both are able to do this , the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them . lastly , the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose . these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives . so , even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money , it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use .  with money orders there is always the problem of mail service . although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service , this is not always the case in foreign countries . this is especially true in underdeveloped nations , where most remittances are sent . a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive . and , there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all , meaning that the sender ' s family could go hungry or end up on the streets .  what is the best way to send remittances ?  by far the most convenient , fast , safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored - value card . with this type of service , a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account ( onto the card ) via loading station , telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country .  the process is extremely easy and cost - effective . funds can be added to the card ' s account at an ever increasing number of convenient locations . the family member overseas can then draw down on those funds by presenting a card from that account to make purchases or they can use the card to withdraw cash from atms . it could not be any simpler .  rlyc has already begun filling orders  in june of this year , rlyc announced that it had received its first order for 2 , 000 pin - based stored value cards . the company stated that its growth estimates call for approximately 2 , 000 new stored - value cards being put into circulation each month . this could result in exponential revenue growth as new customers are added and its customers take advantage of its other financial services . moreover , though other programs it is working on , it could have one half million cards in the market within the next 18 months .  rlyc plans to expand its services through partner companies and one - stop financial centers  rlyc expects to fuel exponential growth of recurring revenue from individual card usage , monthly fees , as well as other activities occurring at its loading centers or the virtual financial centers it is planning . loading centers are retail locations , such as convenience stores , check cashing facilities or other types of retail facilities serving to dispense or receive cash facilitating transactions for the debit card consumer . rlyc has already established strategic relationships with leading card processors , vendors and distributors , and is in program development with key partners that may bring over 100 , 000 retail locations and a host of great opportunities to dramatically increase its brand recognition .  rlyc plans a host of new financial products and service offerings  some of the products and services rlyc plans to be launching in the coming months include commercial , auto and sba loans , mortgages , all types of affinity group ( loyalty / rewards ) cards , pharmacy discount cards , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health savings accounts and health and life insurance . rylc is expanding extremely rapidly and at this pace , should gain a whole lot of exposure to the investment community f - a - s - t ! ! !  rlyc plans to grow through joint ventures and acquisitions  through a well - planned strategy to partner with major players in the financial services industry and through key acquisitions of complimentary companies , rlyc plans to fuel its growth . it has begun identifying and will negotiate business joint ventures , acquisitions and partnerships within the stored value card industry .  rlyc is positioned to offer expanded payroll products as well as define a niche market for its private label stored value solutions . with corporate network ' s assistance , it expects to add new and expansive products linked to its card platform and provide its customers with a growing range of superior products and increased customer loyalty .  rlyc plans to enter the emerging high growth health savings account ( hsa ) market  rlyc has entered into an agreement in principle with mydaily corp . , an employee benefit and financial services company , to provide health saving account ( hsa ) stored value debit cards that will enable employees to easily pay routine medical bills with pre - tax dollars .  health savings accounts ( hsa ) are tax - sheltered savings accounts similar to an ira , but earmarked for medical expenses and are part of a high deductible insurance plan . deposits are 100 % tax - deductible for the self - employed and for employees of companies that offer an hsa .  this could be an enormous new market for rlyc  it is estimated that all millions of non - elderly americans will soon have access to a health savings account , creating a market of unprecedented potential . in fact , due to the rising costs of employer - sponsored health plans , it is also estimated that one in every two major employers in the united states is considering consumer directed health plans and hsa for their employees .  experienced stored value card and financial services industry executive named ceo of relay capital corp .  e . reese bogle iii , experienced financial services and stored value card industry executive , has been named relay ' s . most recently he was one of the founders , and served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of interstate net bank ( www . isnbank . com ) , establishing it as a visa principal member .  prior to this , mr . bogle , was vp of e * trade bank ' s corporate development and strategic alliances group and president of telebanc insurance services , inc . he also served as vp and marketing director of premium bank , and held a variety of managerial and marketing positions at leading financial services companies .  relay will be adding real depth experience to its management team  the next step is to bring a well qualified management team to relay capital said mr . bogle . once the team is onboard , we intend to build relay capital into a diversified financial services provider that , in addition to looking for exponential growth of recurring revenue generated from individual stored card usage , as well as other financial service activities occurring at our card loading centers or its virtual financial centers , we potentially plan to provide : commercial loans , auto loans , sba loans , mortgages , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health benefits ( dental , vision ) , life insurance benefits , pharmacy drug discounts , loyalty and reward programs , and shopping discount programs .  with innovative products and services targeted to trillion dollar market ; a host of powerful partners ; key acquisitions in the works ; orders already coming in ; and a top - notch management team to bring it all together , rlyc seems to be headed for sunny skies .  this company will not remain below the radar screens of wall street ' s mover shakers or even the average investor for much longer . . . if you are on the lookout for companies that have what it takes to experience rapid growth , but are still trading at rock bottom prices , you should call your financial advisor today about relay capital corp .

"Subject: california on the brink - - cera alert  cera alert : december 13 , 2000  title : california on the brink  cera knowledge areas : western energy , n . american power , n . american gas  california on the brink  the california stalemate  california moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over  credit - worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would  avoid selling to the california market . while numerous factors have  contributed to the high cost of power incurred by california ' s utilities , the  root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation . the current  credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address  the situation . the collective efforts of all market participants should be  focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible .  western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this  summer . perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of california  consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis ,  regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and  significant rate increases . the california public utilities commission denied  the requests of pacific gas & electric and southern california edison to end  their rate freezes , forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance  the costs of higher wholesale energy . this has created an unsustainable  accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the california market .  the current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the  galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to  address the underlying structural problems in the industry . however , there is  no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective  solution for customers and the industry as a whole . wholesale and retail  markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain  muddled . in the necessarily political process that will follow , it is  possible that - as has largely been the case so far - the steps taken will fail  to move the california power market toward a more enduring solution and will  instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws .  in the six months since california ' s supply shortfall began plaguing western  markets , regulators have done little to address the underlying problem .  rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage - establishing a market  environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and  demand side responses - efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for  the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers . indeed ,  several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by  discouraging new power plant additions . these include price caps , repeated  changes to market rules , attempts to seize generator profits , and a  challenging siting and permitting process .  medicine worse than the illness  several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in california were  accompanied by very few additions to the supply base . regulators did not pay  adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall . the void of consensus  over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of  bandaid remedies that address the symptoms , but not the cause , of  california ' s electric market woes . *  * challenging siting and permitting . despite state action to better  coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants , power  plant developers still face high hurdles . local community opposition alone  has struck down some key proposed facilities .  * price caps discourage investment . state and federal proposals to cap prices  limit the attractiveness of the california wholesale power market , especially  for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment  to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state .  * repeated rule changes . frequent rule changes in the iso markets ( including  the price caps ) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new  plant development .  * calls for refunds . despite reports by the power exchange , the iso , and the  ferc that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the  california markets , state officials continue to accuse power providers of  gaming the market . calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits  are a threat to new plant development .  * facility inspections . recent inspections of power plants by state officials  to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of  their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust .  cera ' s recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the west  are not guaranteed ? to make a profit . prospects of new plant profitability  are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants , decommissioning of  older units , demand growth , and numerous other difficult - to - forecast factors .  california ' s regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of  financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers  considering entering the state .  despite efforts by the california iso to stimulate new capacity additions in  the state with a special , limited - term capacity payment , cera estimates that  demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the west in 2001 .  in addition , the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a  sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the  earliest . therefore , three years remain before a sufficient quantity of  capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk  of an outage .  the road to recovery  there are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity  shortfall :  * encourage new build . supply must be part of the answer . this requires a  series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build . while in principal  some have been taken , such as new fast track approval , the success of these  actions can only be measured by the build itself . for now , there is still not  enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness . ?  * stabilize investment climate . utilities must have assurance that they will  ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power . this provides the  credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new  build .  * move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios . one of the reasons the  pressure on customers has been so intense in california has been the absence  ( and even discouragement ) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in  the state - particularly for residential and small commercial customers . with  the market at a peak , however , now is in one sense a sub - optimal time to move  toward term contracting . yet these contracts provide the foundation for a  series of actions - including new supply build and demand side investments . if  they end up above market , they will at least have achieved the desired effect  of knocking down prices , a fact which by itself should provide sufficient  justification for recovering the cost of these commitments .  * encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response . although  originally a feature of california ' s market design , most consumers are  insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates . exposing  customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a  demand response .  * encourage market mechanisms that dampen the "" boom bust "" characteristic of  the market . whether in the form of a capacity payment , a reserve requirement ,  or a minimum term portfolio requirement , the california power market needs to  move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the  market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to  elicit new investment . such a structure can help dampen ( but not eliminate )  future price volatility .  * avoid continuously tinkering with the market . while the market does need to  be restructured as described above , it also needs to be stable and reliable  to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long - term  contractual market for power in california . continually tinkering with the  market structure - such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since  july - only serves to undermine confidence in the market . california needs to  do its best to develop a long - term solution and then let the market run its  course .  * allow for greater environmental flexibility . the state should explore a  more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply  shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to  emissions restrictions .  * free purpa power plants to generate . relief should be granted to purpa  power plants that are operational , but are restricted by contract from  operating to generate only power .  * * end * *  this cera alert will be available in pdf format within 24 hours .  this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information  from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

"Subject: alliance info alert  ferc acts to remove obstacles to address western energy crisis  * * omnibus order mobilizes ferc ' s entire energy pricing and infrastructure  authority  * * to adopt financial incentives for capacity increases in transmission  facilities  * * streamlines regulation of wholesale market , energy facilities siting and  licensing  * * promotes conservation and wholesale side of demand - response bidding  * * order doesn ' t address price caps  * * meeting with western state regulators / officials set for april 6 , 2001 in  boise , idaho  ferc moves to bring more economic and reliable energy supplies to the  stressed california and western energy markets . ferc proposes to increase  bulk power supply in the west by removing barriers and providing incentives  that are within its jurisdiction over facility certification , licensing , and  the regulation of transmission and wholesale power sales in interstate  commerce . ferc quickly wants to increase electric generation and  transmission capacity , as well as to streamline the regulation of wholesale  power transactions , as well as increase the capacity of the supporting  infrastructure of natural gas and oil pipelines . the order , which sets new  precedent in its broadness , also proposes actions to reduce electricity  demand in the west as well as promoting the necessary wholesale - market  portion of demand - response bidding where states wish to implement the retail  side . ferc asks for comments on additional actions it may take in the future  by march 30 , 2001 .  effective immediately , ferc said in a statement , * the commission is  streamlining regulatory procedures for wholesale electric power sales ,  expediting the certification of natural gas pipeline projects into california  and the west , including the reallocation of staff resources to more quickly  address pending pipeline applications , and urging all licensees to review  their ferc - licensed hydroelectric projects in order to assess the potential  for increased generating capacity . *  among the actions ferc takes are to : 1 ) require the california iso and  transmission owners within all 11 states of the western systems coordinating  council ( wscc ) to prepare a list of grid enhancements that can be completed  in the short term ; 2 ) waive prior notice requirements for any on - site or  self - generators that sell at wholesale within the wscc area ; 3 ) grant blanket  market - based rate authority for sales on the wholesale market of electric  energy that becomes available as a result of demand - response reductions in  retail and wholesale loads ; and 4 ) broadening and extending through december  31 , 2001 the temporary waivers of the operating and efficiency standards for  qualifying facilities ( qfs ) to increase the availability of generating  capacity .  ferc seeks comments by march 30 on a series of economic incentives aimed at  ensuring timely upgrades to the western transmission grid , including an  increased rate of return on equity ( roe ) for projects that significantly  increase transmission and can be in service by either june 1 , 2001 , or  november 1 , 2001 . other areas that ferc requested comment on include the use  of interconnection authority under the federal power act , and to raise the  dollar limits on the issuance of blanket certificates authorizing gas  pipeline construction . on hydro issues , ferc requested comment on ways to  increase operating flexibility at ferc - licensed projects while protecting  environmental resources .  in its effort to encourage investment in transmission infrastructure , ferc  asked for comments - again by march 30 - on a series of economic incentives  aimed at ensuring upgrades to the western interconnection , including the  increased roe for projects that significantly increase transmission on  constrained paths and can be in service by the above dates in 2001 .  increased roe , ferc said , will also be given to system upgrades over new  transmission paths that can be in service by june 1 , 2002 , or november 1 ,  2002 . ferc seeks comment on a proposed 10 - year depreciation period for  projects that increase transmission capacity in the short - term and a 15 - year  depreciation period for upgrades involving new rights - of - way that can be of  service by november 1 , 2002 .  in his dissent to the order , commissioner massey argued the order focuses on  "" quick fixes , "" and that the measures will not close the gap between supply in  demand in california . the order also "" fails to address price relief , "" noted  massey . massey also called for a full federal power act ( fpa ) section 206  investigation of california issues , which would allow for the possibility of  refunds . on transmission incentive provisions , massey lamented that the  proposed roe increase to 14 percent appeared arbitrary and inconsistent with  ferc policy under order no . 2000 . the financial provisions , he said ,  appeared to be "" just throwing money at the problem . "" while generally  disappointed with the order , massey did express limited support for many  parts of the order . many of the suggestions in the order are the "" same  actions as authorized last may , "" said massey . "" they were good ideas then ,  and they are good ideas now , "" he concluded .  for his part in comments at the open meeting when the order was adopted ,  chairman hebert said the order was designed to "" squeeze every additional mw  of supply available "" and to encourage the conservation of mw , and stressed  that ferc is "" doing all it can in its power to alleviate western problems . ""  he said the order seeks to eradicate the projected supply shortfall in  california , but noted that generation / transmission siting , and conservation  are generally state issues .  ferc ' s * removing obstacles * order is posted on its web site at :  citation : ferc issued is order removing obstacles to increased electric  generation and natural gas supply in the western united states and asking for  comments was issued on march 14 , 2001 , docket no . elol - 47 - 000 .  a detailed analysis and summary of the specific actions taken and proposals  made follows :  electric transmission infrastructure  within 30 days , the california iso and transmission owners in wscc are to  prepare and file for information purposes a list of grid enhancement projects  that may be underway or may not require initial siting and acquisition of  rights of way .  ferc proposes a scaled transmission infrastructure incentive under which  transmission owners of projects that increase transmission capacity at  present constraints and can be in service by july 1 , 2001 would receive a  cost - based rate reflecting a 300 basis point premium return on equity and a  10 - year depreciable life . projects in service by november 1 , 2001 , would get  a 200 basis point premium and 10 - year depreciable life . ferc would use a  uniform baseline return on equity for all jurisdictional transmission  providers in wscc of 11 . 5 % , based on the roe ferc approved for southern  california edison .  system upgrades that involve new rights of way , add significant transfer  capability and can be in service by november 1 , 2002 , would get a cost - based  rate reflecting 12 . 5 % roe , or al 00 basis point premium , and 15 - year  depreciable life .  facilities needed to interconnect new supply to the grid , which go into  service as required to accommodate the in - service date of the new plant would  get a cost - based rate that reflected a 13 . 5 % roe , or a 200 basis point  premium , if in service by november 1 , 2001 and 12 . 5 % roe if in service by  november 1 , 2002 .  for increases in transmission capacity on constrained interfaces that do not  involve significant capital investments , for example , installing new  technology , ferc proposes to allow transmission owners to increase the  revenue requirement of their network service rates to ensure that each  additional mw of capacity will generate revenues equal to their current firm  point - to - point rate . ferc requests comment on whether to assign the cost of  any interconnection or system upgrade to a particular load or supply , or  alternatively , to roll these costs into the average system rate .  extension of waivers for qfs  ferc proposes to extend its temporary waivers of operating and efficiency  standards for qfs - applicable throughout wscc - to allow increased  generation through december 31 , 2001 . the waivers were to expire on april  30 , 2001 . the proposed waiver would allow qualifying cogenerators to sell  their output above the level at which they have historically supplied this  output to purchasing utility . the waiver for qualifying small power  production facilities in wscc with respect to their fuel use requirements  under ferc regulation section 292 . 204 ( b ) , would be extended to december 31 ,  2001 .  additional capacity from on - site generation  ferc will adopt streamlined regulatory procedure to accommodate wholesale  sales from such facilities that serve load within wscc . through december 31 ,  2001 , owners of generating facilities located at business locations in wscc  and used primarily for back - up or self - generation who would become subject  to fpa by virtue of sales of such power will be permitted to sell power at  wholesale without prior notice under fpa section 205 . ferc also authorizes  such power to be sold at market - based rates . ferc waives its prior notice  requirement for mutually agreed upon interconnection agreements for  interconnections necessary to accomplish these sales . quarterly reporting is  required .  allows demand response bidding  ferc will allow retail customers , as permitted by state law , and wholesale  customers to reduce consumption for the purpose of reselling their load  reduction at wholesale . ferc is granting blanket authorization , consistent  with its prior discussion on sales from on - site generation and requires  similar reporting .  ferc ' s december 15 order on the california market directed , as a longer - term  measure that the iso pursue establishing an integrated day - ahead market in  which all demand and supply bids are addressed in one venue . ferc seeks  comments on the desirability of accelerating action on this .  ferc says it realizes that states play an important role in regulating retail  electric service and that allowing retail load to reduce consumption for  resale in wholesale markets raises legal , commercial , technical and  regulatory issues . safeguards may be needed to protect and enhance retail  demand - response bidding programs . intention is not to undermine state  programs but to promote the necessary complementary wholesale programs .  requests comments on how helpful this action is and how it can be  accomplished consistent with state jurisdiction over retail sales .  contract modifications for demand -

"Subject: vince and vasant :  here is a brief summary of my meeting with chris germany , capacity trader at  the east desk , related to gas transmission :  typically , pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis . an example  might be the pipeline between south texas and brooklyn , where you might pay  $ 12 . 00 per month per 10 , 000 decatherms of capacity ( $ 0 . 40 per day ) , a fixed  payment . variable charges are 6 % for fuel costs ( "" shrinkage "" ) and 6 . 5 % for  overhead expenses . a gas trader might call south texas and be quoted a  delivery price tomorrow of nymex - $ 0 . 10 ( "" basis "" ) , and might call brooklyn  and be quoted a delivered price of nymex + $ 0 . 25 . the trader ' s spread is  $ 0 . 35 , and variable costs of transmission are $ 0 . 125 , so the trader would  offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $ 0 . 225 for firm capacity tomorrow .  as for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible , the leaseholders have  an excellent knowledge of the firm - equivalent of interruptible capacity .  also , many pipelines don ' t discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum  ( "" it ' s not worth their time to haggle "" ) ( there is a further issue of  "" secondary markets "" not important to the model yet ) . for south texas and  brooklyn , there are several different routes the gas can physically take  ( pipelines of enron , texas eastern , etc ) . and , once the trade is in the  system traders can cover the ( enron ) positions on each end of the pipeline ,  in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts .  clayton",0

"Subject: re : eprm article  chris ,  this is very well written and will serve the reader well . a few comments .  1 . when i think about the taxonomy of the var models , i typically use the  classification based on 3 categories :  a . variance / covariance method  b . historical simulation  c . monte carlo simulation .  delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear  instrument .  2 . i would define monte carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation  of behavior of  all the market prices / rates , etc . , and revaluation of the entire portfolio .  the revaluation may be based on an approximation ( using taylor ' s expansion )  that may  involve delta , delta / gamma , delta / gamma / omega or may be exact ( based on the  same  model that produces the mark - to - market portfolio valuations ) .  the main benefit of using the mc simulation in the energy markets is the  ability to capture  the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way . i would  emphasize that  there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the v / c model ( i shall send you  the references  from home ) .  3 . i would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets  that are evolving  quickly ( new instruments for which we have no comparable prices ,  behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de - mature ) .  4 . for bigger portfolios , virtually all methods require some level of  aggregation into  atomic , elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem .  this process may be a source of a big error .  5 . the computational burden of mc can be reduced through clever preprocessing  of a portfolio that introduces no error . many swaps with the same underlying  can be aggregated into one positions ( they are portfolios of forwards and  they are linear  instruments ) .  please , feel free to use any comment ( or none ) .  vince  "" chris strickland "" on 08 / 28 / 2000 02 : 58 : 56 pm  please respond to "" chris strickland ""  to :  cc :  subject : eprm article  dear vince ,  ?  d you think you might be able to look at this in the next day or so ? robin  is after something by the end of this week .  ?  best regards .  ?  chris .  ?  - eprm _ 01 _ var . doc",0

"Subject: non - firm power curve building  hi vince ,  amitava and i have received a request to build a non - firm power curve for  each region from david hoog ' s double trigger folks . the objective , as they  explain it , is to allow the desk to buy non - firm from the market , buy david ' s  outage product , and sell firm to the market . accountants would like a curve  to mark the non - firm position .  my initial thought is that the desk should provide this non - firm curve , but  it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they  have put the ball in david hoog ' s court to build the curve if david wants to  sell his product internally to the desk .  assuming we build the curve , the next issue is how to define "" non - firm "" ?  the only way i can think of is to tie the non - firmness to a specific  generation unit or group of units . this will allow the purchase of david ' s  outage product to cover the non - firmness risk . tying the definition of  non - firmness to a whole region seems implausible - - - what does it mean to  give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem  anywhere in the region ? consequently , the non - firm curve takes on a  unit - level interpretation , and not a region - level interpretation .  consequently , i do not see how we can talk about the "" non - firm curve for the  region "" ? we will need to build a non - firm curve for each generation unit or  group of units .  maybe i could get your thoughts later today .  thanks ,  vasant",0

"Subject: re : short - sell vs exercise  chonawee ,  as i have pointed out , short - selling the stock may be a bad  decision because of tax implications ( ignoring the legal aspects ) .  suppose the strike is $ 70 and you were granted an atm option .  you sell short at $ 70 ten lots ( one lot = 100 shares ) . the price goes to  $ 100 .  you lose $ 30 x 1000 = $ 30 , 000 on your short position . option exercise  gives you $ 30 , 000 . this is before taxes . you pay taxes  on your option income ( it ' s treated as ordinary income ) . the tax is  28 % x $ 30 , 000 = $ 8 , 400 . you can use only $ 3 , 000 of your loss against  ordinary income . this saves you only $ 840 in taxes .  of course , if you have capital gains , you can use losses on your option  position  as an offset .  the remaining part of your capital loss is carried forward and you get the  tax benefits over time ( less the time value of money ) , assuming you have  income in the  future ( or capital gains ) .  not so good .  by the way , valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options  is a very interesting and difficult problem .  vince  chonawee supatgiat @ enron  07 / 10 / 2000 11 : 40 am  to : stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : short - sell vs exercise  below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere . it  explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised  but cannot be sold . ( as we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call  option before its maturity ) . however , after taking vince ' s comments on the  ordinary income / capital loss tax offsetting issue , i think this is not a good  article anymore . i guess i could just throw this article away . : - )  - chonawee  short - selling is better than exercising your employee stock options  in general , the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when  you speculate that ene is going down or its growth rate is extremely low . in  fact , when exercising the options , you are speculating that ene would never  reach this point ( plus interest ) again during the 10 years maturity date or  until you leave the company . if you do not anticipate that , you should hold  on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your  exercise .  however , if you believe that ene is reaching its peak . then , instead of  exercising the options , you should short - sell ( or sell ) the stocks in that  amount . after short - selling , when you feel that the stock starts to go up ,  you can buy them back ( to cover ) , make profit , and still keep the options . on  the other hand , if the stock does not go down as expect , you can exercise the  options to cover your short position anytime .  let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes , no dividends ,  and zero risk - free rate . suppose that ene follows a simple sample path as  follow  if you exercise 100 ene options with a grant price of 45 when ene reaches 70 ,  you would earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . but if you short sell 100 ene at 70 , no  matter how much ene is in the future , you can exercise the options to cover  the short position and still earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . the advantage of  short - selling comes when ene at the period 2 is 60 . at this point , you can  cover your short position , get ( 70 - 60 ) * 100 = $ 1 , 000 , and still keep your  options or you can exercise the options and gain $ 2 , 500 . that is , you still  keep the flexibility of your options when you short - sell . in conclusion , the  only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your  short position .",0

"Subject: pserc denver meeting  vince ,  the pserc meeting lance and i went to was both interesting  and boring . pserc has 11 school members and 30 industry members . its research  program consists of three stems : markets , transmission and distribution ,  and systems . ( enron ' s interests probably lie mainly in the first stem . )  in morning of the first day , researchers from universities  presented their project proposals . i found some of them  quite interesting . for example , shmuel oren , fernando alvarado ,  tim mount ( of cornell ) propose to study "" market redesign : incorporating  the lessons learned from actual experiences for enhancing market  design , "" shijie deng , s . oren et al propose to study "" power asset  valuation model in a market - based and reliability - constrained electric  power system . "" the first got funded but the second did not .  in the same afternoon industry and academic separated to have their  own discussion . i went to the academic discussion and lance the  industry one . i hope my presence there did not make things worse , for  the discussion revealed a lot of organizational chaos and confusion .  the proposal screen process got a lot of heat from participants .  the proposal process goes as follows : researchers first write a short  proposal to appropriate stem committee ( no industry participantion , it seems  to me ) ,  each committee then ranks the proposal and selects the top 3 or 4 . the  selected  proposals are then expanded to be present to the industry . industry then  gets to vote which proposals get funded . however , some researchers were  very unhappy about the initial ranking and selection process . there were  accusation of self - ranking , communication between stem committee and  member schools breaking down , and so on . some were even asking for  some sort of assurance that the project will be funded even before wrting it  ( the arguement was "" then it was a waste of our time to write proposals "" ,  which i found quite amusing ) .  all in all , i found the process was not taken seriously enough by university  researchers . pserc has been established for 5 years now and it still does  not have a proper proposal screen process , which is hard to believe . also ,  the communication among university researchers , between stem committee  and member schools , and most importantly , between researchers and industry ,  are not smooth as all .  since the proposals are voted by 30 or so industry members , the "" right ""  projects may not get funded . too many participants also make the decision  process very indecisive and quite painful to watch ( lance can comment on  this better ) . they also wanted to spread the fund among all schools which  made the voting a less authoritive .  i believe enron will not get much returns from join pserc ( price tag is  $ 40 , 000  per company per year ) . if we find some projects interesting , we can sponsor  the schools in the form of summer interns , the schools claim that most of the  fund  goes to support students anyway .  alex",0

( i will be glad to put  this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move  forward . )  i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of  our  approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you  might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you  were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the  same  time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the  benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a  complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i  would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i  look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as  a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to  earn and secure your business .  if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount  marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest  you  begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1  day training seminar .  our clients are usually very fluent after that 1  day training seminar .  thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a  few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable  before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks  later .  thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting  that  i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show  anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the  meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted .  dale nesbitt  president  marketpoint inc .  27121 adonna ct .  los altos hills , ca 94022  ( 650 ) 218 - 3069  dale . nesbitt @ marketpointinc . com  ( see attached file : license . doc )",0

"Subject: a basic idea of price - offer matching clauses  vince -  here is the basic idea i was alluding to :  suppose a car dealer promised to "" match any advertised price . "" then his  competitor would feel the need to respond in kind . and so on , until all  dealers advertised they would "" match any advertised price . "" now , consider one  of these dealer ' s decision to perhaps lower his prices . if he does so ,  everyone will immediately match his price , so his market share will remain  unchanged , at whatever it was before , but his revenues ( and all other dealers  as well ) would be lowered by the amount of his price reduction . so , the  dealer rationally decides not to lower his prices to try to sell more cars .  now , suppose a limited partnership , where the partners contract to "" control ""  who they are in business with , by putting a "" right of first refusal "" clause  into the partnership ' s papers , whereby any partner wishing to sell his  interests must offer the remaining partners the right to match any offer the  partner received from outside for his shares . now , suppose you are an  outsider , considering doing your due diligence in the thought you might want  to buy into the partnership . you know if your offer is a "" good "" one from your  perspective , offering you the prospects of a fair rate of return , the  existing partners will match it , and you will get nothing in the deal but you  will have paid , from your own pocket , for your due diligence . conversely , if  you offer too much for the shares , then the other partners will not match  your offer and you will then realize you overpaid . in neither case can you  credibly assume you know more about the business than do the current  partners . so , you ( basically ) don ' t make an offer . so , a partner ' s shares  are seriously devalued by his partners having the right to match any offers  he receives for them . the "" right of first refusal "" clause precludes  economically efficient rebalancing of portfolios by rendering the shares  ( essentially ) illiquid .  clayton",0

"Subject: alliance info alert - ferc reporting  attached is a summary of recent ferc activities ( pdf file ) and the weekly  alliance express . the following is a summary of the most recent ferc meeting ,  followed by a listing of the most recent ferc filings .  in a brief meeting yesterday , ferc approved a final rule adopting section 203  merger filing requirements , generally as proposed , and extended the existing  nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time that the new york market can be  determined to be "" workably competitive . "" at the same time , ferc ordered a  technical conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and  urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next  steps , and deadlines for resolution / implementation . additional details are  provided below .  ferc updates , streamlines merger filing process  ferc unanimously approved its proposed order revising the reporting  requirements for mergers . however , comm . hebert did so with reservations , as  discussed below . commission staff stated that the order closely follows the  notice of proposed rulemaking previously issued , but adds more detail and  more certainty to the industry . staff stated that the order is improved over  the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain  entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products .  according to ferc , the draft order :  - revises the commission ' s filing requirements to reflect existing merger  policy based on ferc ' s 1996 merger policy guidelines ;  - provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market  analyses . the rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with  potential horizontal competitive concerns . in addition , the rule establishes  informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses .  - streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise  competitive concerns ; and  - reduces the industry ' s regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing  requirements .  the rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the federal  register .  commissioner reaction :  comm . hebert expressed reservations that , although he was voting for the  rule , ferc should not be duplicating the department of justice ( doj ) and the  federal trade commission ( ftc ) market concentration analyses and that ferc  should follow the lead of anti - trust enforcement officials , who could also  analyze mergers faster and more confidentially . he also stated that ferc  should review the filings after the doj or the ftc review them , not before ,  and that there should be a definite time frame for review . hebert did  mention that he was pleased that rtos and the disposition of transmission  assets would be exempt , that ancillary services would be considered as a  separate product and that the final rule opens the door for alternative  market analysis .  comm . breathitt supported the final rule , stating that it should expedite the  approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the  fact that older , irrelevant requirements have been dropped . she indicated  that the final rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting  the public interest by stating that the process will be "" efficient yet  sufficient "" . the commissioner said that she was pleased the final rule  addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail  competition and one of her main concerns , confidentiality .  comm . massey fully supported the final rule , emphasizing that it would  improve response time , lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the  industry to better predict commission actions . like commissioner breathitt ,  massey was pleased that the order will allow market modeling analysis that  will better enable ferc to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants  to point to other factors when concentration appears too high . massey also  stated that the new rule includes the ability to address many of ferc ' s  concerns , such as future mergers when they occur in succession , retail  competition , mitigation by the enlargement of markets through rtos and  analysis of ancillary services . in sum , he averred that the order will  provide ferc with the tools it needs for accurate analysis , while taking into  consideration the rapid changes in the industry .  chairman hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was  a very important rule . in response to comm . hebert , chairman hoecker said  that the doj and ftc actually wait for ferc ' s report before issuing their  own , that the anti - trust enforcement agencies rely on ferc ' s expertise when  reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries . there is a major  positive connection between industry consolidation and rtos and that both are  reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work , he noted . because the  rtos enlarge the size of the subject market , he indicated , rtos will help to  preserve competition . therefore , more and larger rtos should allow for more  mergers , he said . the chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that  joining an rto is a requirement for a merger , but that it would certainly be  viewed favorably .  nyiso bid caps extended until ancillary service market shown to be workably  competitive  in a 3 - 1 decision , with comm . hebert dissenting , ferc extended the existing  nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be  "" workably competitive . "" at the same time , ferc ordered a technical  conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and urged market  participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next steps , and  deadlines for resolution / implementation .  in so doing , ferc rejected certain aspects of nyiso ' s september 1 and 8 , 2000  compliance filing , submitted pursuant to its may 31 , 2000 order imposing a  temporary bid cap through october 31 . the iso ' s efforts to correct market  flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had  not yet satisfied the commission ' s directives , ferc concluded . ferc found  that while nyiso has achieved solid progress in certain areas , overall the  iso has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then  gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the iso ' s non - spinning reserve  market by april 2001 , as the iso requested .  commissioner reaction :  comms . hoecker , massey and breathitt all endorsed the order as an "" imperfect  solution , "" yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the  iso ' s market . comm . hebert faulted the commission for squandering an  opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls .  hoecker and breathitt joined hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack  of the iso ' s progress , but contended that significant outstanding issues must  be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted .  in other action , ferc accepted nyiso ' s and nepool ' s proposed emergency energy  transaction agreement , allowing nyiso and iso - ne to provide emergency service  to each other ( ero 0 - 3638 - 000 ) ;  stricken items included cae - 16 ( nepool ' s 64 th agreement amendment proposing  the elimination of in service and instituting new rules governing certain  import transactions ( ero 0 - 3577 - 000 ) ) .  = = recent ferc filings = =  ( 1 ) rto developments  * iso ne submitted its changes to market rule 17 , market monitoring ,  reporting and market power mitigation , in compliance with the commission ' s  july 26 , 2000 order . erol - 368 - 000 . filed november 1 , 2000 .  * iso ne submitted its special interim market rule in compliance with the  commission ' s july 26 , 2000 order . ero 0 - 369 - 000 . filed november 1 , 2000 .  * illinois industrial energy consumers filed to intervene regarding dynegy ' s  filing to request approval for the withdrawal of the illinois power co . from  the miso . erol - 123 - 000 . filed november 6 , 2000 .  * el segundo power filed a motion "" requesting order on request for rehearing  by date certain "" in complaint that challenges the ca iso ' s ability to set the  rates for the energy that it can compel generators to produce for reliability  under its standard form contract . ero 0 - 1830 - 001 . filed november 3 , 2000 .  * ca iso filed an unbundled grid management charge in order to recover its  administrative and operating costs . erol - 313 - 000 . comments due by november  22 , 2000 .  * nepool submitted supplemental information related to its filing of the  sixty - fourth agreement amending the nepool agreement , which proposed the  elimination of in service . ero 0 - 3577 - 000 . comments due by november 14 , 2000 .

"Subject: re : insead high - tech acquisitions workshop  ben  thanks for attending . i was on "" vacation "" last week ( driving from ca to  houston )  and could not answer your first message regardoing insead conference in time .  the objective was to find out more about the he workshop on high - tech  acquisitions  and evaluate the usefulness of the program for enron . i shall be making a  recommendation  to jeff skilling that we should work with wharton as a partner in a number of  different research projects .  i shall try to catch you next week to find out what was said about valuation  of small high - tech firms .  vince  benjamin parsons  06 / 12 / 2000 05 : 50 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc : bryan seyfried / lon / ect @ ect  subject : insead high - tech acquisitions workshop  vince  i attended the workshop on high - tech acquisitions at insead on saturday  alongside participants from cisco , eads , razorfish and cable + wireless , and  academics from insead and wharton . the basic premise was to discuss and get  feedback from practitioners about the research project , and a phd study which  is currently underway at wharton . the discussions were very interesting -  especially as this was my first exposure to this area .  examples of the discussions raised include  why firms acquire new businesses instead of developing them in - house  what degree of post - acquisition integration was optimal  difficulties of us firms acquiring euro / asian high - tech companies  how to value small high - tech firms  how to quantify the success / failure of an acquisition  my feeling is that further work with them in this area would be beneficial to  enron because it would help the development of the academic research and give  us first - hand access to the results . plus it would enable us to learn from  the mistakes of others , through meeting practitioners at such workshops and  having greater access to the case studies . i guess it could also aid our  realignment within the high - tech / communication industry to be seen in such  studies .  regards  ben",0
