'  state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz  the economic times , friday apr 27 2001  dpc board empowers md to cancel mseb contract  the enron power project crisis on thursday deepened with the board of dabhol power company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board even while international lenders to the project asked enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the mseb .  the decision to authorise managing director neil mcgregor to issue "" notice of termination on the contract to sell 740 mw of power "" was taken after the board prevented mseb from voting on the ground that it was an interested party . the decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposition vote was cast by idbi , sources said .  according to reports , financial institutions such as anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , citibank , abn - amro and the state bank of india have on wednesday advised enron against terminating its ppa with mseb . mseb chairman vinay bansal , who with two other directors attended the meeting on wednesday representing maharashtra ' s 15 per cent stake in the near $ 3 - billion project , said : "" the indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if enron broke the contract . "" while bansal declined comment on the board decision , the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the state . ( pti )  the economic times , friday apr 27 2001  mseb pays rs 134 cr under ' protest ' to dpc  despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dabhol . "" we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh "" , a senior mseb official said . "" we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members "" , mseb sources said .  last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that it would not accept "" protest payments "" anymore . cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the "" purported protest or reservation "" . mseb had paid a rs 113 . 5 crore february bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the multinational ' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state government . ( pti )  business standard , friday , april 27 , 001  enron india md authorised to terminate ppa  the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) , at its meeting in london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra state electricity board and the state government . "" the board has authorised wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises , "" a state government source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure from its lenders .  the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of the board ' s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc ' s lenders , who had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice . the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders , who have an exposure of about $ 2 billion in the project . sources said given the lenders ' strong opposition to termination of the contract , the enron board ' s "" enabling resolution "" did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract .  enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party . the idbi representative protested against the board ' s decision . the meeting was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills .  after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill , dpc invoked the state government ' s guarantee and then the union government ' s counter guarantee . when payment of the rs 127 - crore january bill became overdue , dpc again invoked the state government ' s guarantee . mseb retaliated on january 28 , 2001 by slapping a rs 401 - crore penalty for non - supply of electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against this penalty . "" this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting "" , a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb ' s stand and refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration between the centre and dpc is currently on .  the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001  foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan  global banks comfortable with enron pull - out  lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot . international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical that additional assistance to dpc ' s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the authorisation given to enron india ' s managing director k wade cline and dpc president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer notices to mseb , following wednesday ' s dpc board meeting in london .  the essence of the message from the international lenders following the london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc ' s debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is . however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a messy affair .  sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no security - other than assets - like a sovereign cover . "" it was this desperation that made local lenders like idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5 per cent , "" a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a ) there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power .  while local lenders led by idbi - with mseb parroting the same - were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets - even those under phase - i - getting attached . therefore , an examination on the segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted .  pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday .  the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb  the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp , has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo neil mcgregor and enron india ' s managing director k wade cline to serve a ' ' preliminary ' ' termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24 million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on thursday .  the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision as a ' ' procedural ' ' move consistent with dpc ' s negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb .  after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated , the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty . ' ' our ( centre ' s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million , ' ' power secretary a k basu said . ' ' contractually , the centre will have to pay one year ' s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore , and take over dpc ' s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project was terminated , ' ' basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which is 95 per cent through .  while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had strongly opposed dpc ' s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices for termination .  mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar - both directors on the dpc board - and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly ' ' threatening ' ' to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra - a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war , coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc ' s move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers .  the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001  offer of renegotiation ' too late ' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar  mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa .  as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death of the project ' ' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved ' ' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some arm - twisting .  at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late ' ' . it also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon .  the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc would not take any ` ` harsh step ' ' which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation was the requirement and not confrontation .  echo in ls  the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister , mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the centre ' s liability in case of termination is one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million .  blow to fis  the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the centre or the state .  the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001  enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait  the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet , considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders ' consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project . the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a move .  another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms . institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package , which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , ' ' said mseb chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings . ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable , "" bansal added .  ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction , ' ' said a top banker who was present during the lenders ' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , ' ' he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india , where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings .  meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa . ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , ' ' deshmukh said . deshmukh was echoing union power minister suresh prabhu ' s sentiments , who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however , added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would be a blow to india ' s efforts to woo foreign investors .  the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december 2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest payment , despite the dispute over the amount .  when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc .  the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001  dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice  the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time ' ' . the decision was taken at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an ` interested party ' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter , ' ' a senior state government official said .  the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a six - month ` ` suspension period ' ' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances . . . ' '  idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however , domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa is abandoned mid - way .  according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now have to decide what is the ` appropriate time ' to serve the notice , ' ' the official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134 crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was paid ` in protest ' ' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , ' ' a senior mseb official said .  the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron testing maharashtra ' s nerves , t n raghunatha  dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the dpc board of directors ' decision to authorise its managing director to serve a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication .  the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of "" interested party "" .  when contacted , the company ' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal , declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board . "" we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express our views after a few days , "" he said . however , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board ' s decision as "" unfortunate "" . "" we have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision "" , mr deshmukh said in mumbai .  official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board ' s decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state electricity board . the sources said that the dpc ' s reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of the power contract with the mseb .  "" if anything , the dpc ' s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb , the centre and the state government , "" the sources said . not surprisingly , the dpc ' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government ' s decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron ' s subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc .  riday , april 27  the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron signal to switch off dabhol power  enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol power company when it won an authorisation from the company ' s board to stop sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) .  the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65 per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre ' s liability , if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year ' s power bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out . "" we do not see fdi inflows into the power sector being hit , "" power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore ' protest payment ' by the cash - strapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore .  there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers at enron ' s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide bandh . "" we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up at the dispute - resolution forum , "" a board official said . last week , dpc told the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position .  mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions are not covered under the centre ' s and state ' s counter - guarantees , unlike those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh called enron ' s decision unfortunate . "" we had told state government officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties . ""  the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron threatens to pull out  the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9 billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of dabhol ' s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board , mr vinay bansal .  while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu , who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday .  the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 . 7 per cent of the total energy output of the country , its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation .  however , if terminations proceedings go through , enron corp , a 65 per cent share - holder in the dabhol power company , would stand to net a hefty amount in damages . the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 , 800 crore , which is the total of one years ' electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . according to an energy analyst , mr pradyumna kaul , the total liability would not cross rs 350 crore . however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 , 840 crore . it is learnt that on 20 april , mr deshmukh had given the go - ahead to the mseb to prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc ' s board of directors on wednesday . at the meeting , the energy minister , padamsinh patil , energy secretary , mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr vinay bansal , were also present . the notice was prepared over the past weekend and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april . however , the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough , given its huge stake in the project , and that such a notice would not be necessary . the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff , with enron ' s consent .  among those present at the london meeting were mr lal , mr bansal and mseb technical director , mr p paunikar , in their capacity as directors . however , they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party . the only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also represented on the board , it is learnt . the chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , said the state was not in favour of terminating the project . this could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm - twist the indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months cleared . the mseb owes enron rs 146 . 64 crore for march 2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 . the centre today put up a brave face on enron ' s decision saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country , pti reported from new delhi .  "" there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company . as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on fdi in power sector , "" power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when asked about dpc ' s decision to authorise management to issue a termination notice to mseb . emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision , prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs "" we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as european nations in the power sector . "" in fact not only the power minister but also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector . ""  mid day  ' dpc may not wind up '  maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor , managing director of the dabhol power corporation ( dpc ) , has been given complete powers with regard to dpc ' s operations in the state , including the authority to wind up operations , it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor will issue such a termination notice . mcgregor was given the powers at a meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday . ranganathan said that state officials , including maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) chairman vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal , have reported back to him about the meeting in london .  with regard to the state ' s failure to pay enron , ranganathan said , "" bills are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and dpc owes some money to us . our people informed enron officials about this . . in fact , there was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice . "" in the london meeting , mseb and industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could not supply power whenever needed .  chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the enron - promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to wind up operations . deshmukh added , "" we have already requested enron not to take any harsh decision . "" deshmukh had earlier said , "" we have directed state government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state , as it would be harmful to both of us . ""  enron officials are keeping mum on the issue . mcgregor said , "" i am not going to give any comment . ""  mid day , april 27 , 2001  enron offers ' no comment ' on renegotiation , h s rao  a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company ( dpc ) , promoted by the us energy major enron , was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its $ 900 - million power project in maharashtra , but there was no official word on the indian and state governments ' decision to renegotiate the contract .  an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting , saying the issues discussed at the meeting were ' confidential ' . "" we have not received any direct communication . unless we get it and evaluate the details , we have no comments to make , "" the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on re - negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) has 15 per cent stake .  asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india , the spokesman said he had nothing to say on them . enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to look at various options including selling the company ' s stake in dpc . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company . he said the maharashtra government "" is not in favour of terminating the 2184 - mw project , but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio . ""  mid day , friday , april 27 , 2001 ,  committee to renegotiate enron deal  a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power company will be appointed by this evening , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said today . addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha , deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow , at the most . he termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with power company .  "" renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee . we don ' t want to take any hasty decision , "" deshmukh saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably . when pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite state  s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee , chief minister said it was unfortunate .  earlier , in his meeting with hazare , deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people . he also gave a patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months .  afternoon , april 27 , 2001  ' enron ' s on ! '  state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz  the us power giant , enron power corporation ' s willingness to wrap up the dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise , though the dabhol power company chief , mr . wade cline , has been authorised to do so , since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter .  disclosing this , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power project at dabhol could be continued , and at the same time enron did not feel slighted . "" enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision . we are waiting for their letter , "" he said . when asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge , mr . deshmukh said , "" let our officers come back . after that we will decide a future course of action . but we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project . it is very difficult to predict the outcome of enron ' s decision but as of now the project is still on . "" when asked whether the project could be moved to another state , if wound up from maharashtra , mr . deshmukh said , that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government . however , it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself , he indicated . he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses if the project was terminated .  the board of directors of the dabhol power company , which met in london on wednesday , decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project , if he deemed it fit . however , this decision , as of now , does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project . the enron project , which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception , had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time . the previous sena - bjp government , which had been out to terminate the project , however , chose to continue with it following renegotiations with enron ' s top visiting officials like ms . rebecca mark . and , the democratic front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago .  meanwhile , state energy minister dr . padamsinh patil , when contacted at the osmanabad circuit house , said the state government and the central government have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with enron . "" it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that . they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides , "" he said . in case the project is terminated , the government can still manage the power needs of the state , though it would be a bit tough job , he added .",0

"Subject: alliance info alert : ferc report on western markets  at its special meeting today , ferc released the results of its eagerly  awaited probe into california ' s summer power crisis , concluding that under  certain circumstances , california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and  unreasonable power rates due to california ' s "" seriously flawed "" market  structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions  throughout the west .  the ferc staff report on western markets and the causes of the summer 2000  price abormalities , entitled , part i of staff report on u . s . bulk power  markets , is available at the following website :  in response , ferc issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural  changes to the california iso and px to help remedy the pricing problems , and  solicited public comment by november 22 . a technical conference has also  been scheduled for november 9 , to discuss the proposed solutions and other  remedies that might be suggested ( details tba ) . while all four commissioners  supported the order , the order stretched the commission . chairman hoecker  and comm . breathitt expressed strong endorsements , while comms . hebert and  massey concurred , citing areas where they felt the commission had either  "" over - reached "" or not gone far enough , as discussed below . a final order is  expected to be issued by year ' s end .  at the same time , the commission warned california consumers of their  continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve  state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability of day  ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand responses ; ( 3 )  siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of sufficient  reserve requirements .  highlights of proposed california structural remedy  in its order , ferc proposed a series of market overhauls , including :  ( 1 ) eliminating the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s  investor - owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the px , and allowing  these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other  alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks .  ( 2 ) requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their  transactions in the day - ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for  under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements ) , in  order to discourage over - reliance on the real - time spot market .  ( 3 ) establishing independent , non - stakeholder governing boards for the iso  and px .  ( 4 ) modifying the current single price auction system by ( a ) imposing a  temporary $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap "" that prohibits supply bids in excess of $ 150  from setting the market - clearing price for all bidders ; ( b ) requiring sellers  bidding above $ 150 / mwh to report their bids to ferc on a confidential , weekly  basis and provide certain cost support ; and ( c ) requiring the iso and px to  report monthly information on such bids . the commission ' s price mitigation  measures would remain in effect through december 31 , 2002 .  ( 5 ) declining to order retroactive refunds for the state ' s ratepayers and  utilities , citing insufficient authority to do so , but subjecting sellers to  potential refund liability for transactions from october 2 , 2000 until  december 21 , 2002 , but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs , if  ferc finds non - competitive behavior .  ( 6 ) encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand  response management programs .  separately , the draft order rejected the iso ' s request for an extension of  its current purchase price cap authority , and the px ' s request for price  capping authority .  commissioner responses  comm . herbert reluctantly concurred , noting that his decision may change when  a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at  the november 9 meeting . he stressed that he would have preferred that the  order address four areas : ( 1 ) eliminate all price controls in california  markets ; ( 2 ) abolish the single price auction entirely ; ( 3 ) terminate the  "" buy and sell "" mandate in the px ; and ( 4 ) direct the iso to address a long  list of cited problems in its january 2001 rto filing , rather than having the  commission prescribe specific remedies .  hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the "" soft cap ""  concept , if one had to be adopted , then the soft cap should increase  incrementally increase over time at specific pre - announced dates . he  believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in  facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive  for california regulators to address market design and other flaws . also , he  would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time , but  allow the iso and px to address this issue in their january 2001 rto  filings . in addition , he would not dictate risk management methods ,  preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on  their own . finally , he advised californians not to be so environmentally  focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation  capacity .  comm . breathitt stated her approval of the order while warning that ferc  cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress  towards open and competitive markets . she noted that it was the commission ' s  job to guide the market to self - correct and not to conduct "" command and  control . "" she also commended the managers of the iso and px , saying that  they have performed admirably . however , she noted she is awaiting comments  on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential  reporting requirements .  comm . massey concurred , but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive  approach . he feels that the congress has "" put its thumb on the scale "" in the  federal power act to protect consumers . stating that prices will continue to  be unreasonable in the future , he believes that this order moves in the right  direction , by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over  reliance on the spot market , lack of demand response , the need to  reconstitute governance of the iso and px and the elimination of the buy / sell  mandate . comm . massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the  $ 150 / mwh soft cap went far enough , whether ferc has the legal authority to  issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a  certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market  price volatility .  finally , chairman hoecker stated his strong support of the order , but noted  that this is "" no time to pull punches . "" he emphasized that the commission  needed frank comments from the industry . he echoed comm . breathitt ' s warning  that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on  track . noting that the commission lacked authority to order refunds , he  stated that the responsibility rests with congress . addressing  jurisdictional issues , he stated that siting problems encountered at the  state level are slowing the "" meandering transition "" to competition . he feels  that the state of california and ferc need to work together to resolve these  problems and that ferc is not attempting to usurp power . rather , california  is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region  for reliable energy , thus placing the burden on federal action to make things  work , hoecker maintained . the chairman also said that the commission will  fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further  evidence provided by staff ' s ongoing investigation .  if you have any questions or comments , please call jack cashin at  202 / 508 - 5499 .",0

"Subject: mark - to - market  bob ,  i wanted to continue the analysis on mark - to - market that i had spoken to you  about on the phone .  i thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction  by phone , so i am having krishnarao who is in vince ' s group explain the  transaction to you .  krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in india , and he has just  returned to houston from india after working with the team here .  he will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction . i would  like you to please spend some time with him , and then based on the discussion  please send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to  market .  please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from  the indian side . this is a very important transaction for us , and we may  need to repeat this in coming months , hence setting up the system to account  for these maybe well worth it . also , what i am concerned about is that there  will be an enron india ( eipl ) account in india based on indian gaap , and upon  consolidation there will be a us gaap accounting in the us . it is here that  we would like to have mark - to - market accounting . eipl is structured through  mauritius , and then caymen islands .  another key question to consider is that when we m - t - m the transaction in the  us there will be a tax accruing in the year of m - t - m ( say 2000 ) . however , in  india , as a result of the accrual accounting , there will not be any income  showing till the year 2002 or 2003 . we will need to know how that would get  treated , and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the  us . i am also confused about whether us tax would be levied , since none of  the income is being brought back into the us ( remains overseas - subpart - f  and other concerns ) .  finally , we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and  getting a fixed for floating swap in the us ( this is still not allowed to  indian corporates ) . i need you to think about this too , and see if some type  of accounting will solve this issue . krishna knows what i am talking about ,  and will brief you on the same .  krishna - please walk bob through the three structures we had worked here .  look forward to your help and comments . this is going to be an exciting  project for us all .  regards ,  sandeep .",0

"Subject: organizational changes  to : enron north america corp .  from : cliff baxter and kevin hannon  in july , as part of the enron north america ( ena ) reorganization , the  implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the  continued growth of ena including : 1 ) accelerate the development of our  people , 2 ) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets ,  and 3 ) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups , both  within ena and across enron . consistent with these objectives and with the  corporate goal of fostering   b ) the downstream coverage / origination groups which focus on delivering a  broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers  including pulp and paper , chemicals , plastics , refined products , metals and  mining , heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation ,  textiles and glass manufacturing the eastern and western u . s . midstream  coverage / origination groups which focus on energy , finance and industries .  downstream coverage / origination  as energy deregulation continues in north america , it is becoming clear that  the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both  ena and enron corp . further , it is clear that ena can significantly expand  its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial  solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of enron  corp . against this backdrop , the downstream coverage / origination function  will expand its product offering to include not only ena  , s existing energy  commodities , energy services , finance , assets and pulp and paper capabilities  but also ees  , s energy outsourcing capability and global fuel  , s chemicals ,  plastics and refined products risk management capability . these additional  capabilities will be offered in conjunction with ees and the global fuels  groups . given the size and importance of this enron initiative , greg piper  will be returning from portland to manage this business . under greg  , s  leadership , the downstream origination effort will be segmented into three  sub - groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering :  a ) pulp and paper  ) edward ondarza will continue to manage the coverage  activities in the pulp and paper business . this group will be responsible for  the provision of innovative  products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision  of paper risk management products ;  b ) chemicals , plastics and refined products  ) we have asked jim ajello to  lead the coverage activities in this business . this group will be  responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the  chemicals and refined products industries ;  c ) non - integrated industrials  ) bruce garner , formerly leader of bankers  trust  , s global metals and mining group in london , has joined ena to lead the  coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the  provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining ,  heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation , textiles  and glass manufacturing industries .  midstream coverage / origination  a ) eastern coverage / origination  ) this group  , activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the eastern  interconnect . we have asked janet dietrich to assume the leadership of this  group ;  b ) western coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the wscc . they  will also continue to manage all qualified facilities ( qf ) restructuring  opportunities in the western u . s . we have asked chris calger to assume the  leadership of this coverage group . chris will relocate to portland from  calgary where he currently leads the canadian downstream origination efforts ;  c ) ipp merchant coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  the provision of structured energy , finance and asset solutions for the  emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio  , s of merchant  power generation either through development or acquisition . we have asked  mike miller to assume the leadership of this group . in addition , mike will  continue to manage the power development activities in the eastern  interconnect ;  d ) eastern qf restructuring  ) this group will focus on the qf restructuring  opportunities in the eastern interconnect including the existing  restructuring and re - capitalization of the east coast power assets . we have  asked dave duran to assume the leadership of this business . greg blair ,  formerly of enron asia  , s development group , doug clifford , formerly of  citizens power , and dick lydecker , formerly of cogen technology , will join  this newly formed business .  2 ) commercial transactions :  the commercial transactions group ( ctg ) , co - headed by ray bowen and jeff  donahue , was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of  transactions within ena  ) and thereby , improve ena  , s efficiency in executing  transactions and free - up the origination groups to increase their intensity  of client coverage . ctg consists of six primary functions : transaction  development , capital structuring and portfolio management , commodity  structuring and transportation , transactional support / accounting , technical  analysis and upstream asset management .  the transaction development group will be responsible for deal leadership ,  execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction  with the originator . the function will be divided into four teams , each of  which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups . this  dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link , better service  and greater accountability with the origination groups ; however , the ctg  resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to  the highest value transactions across the coverage functions :  a ) midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and  western coverage / origination groups . the senior members of this group  include billy lemmons , george mccormick , erin norris and russ porter . billy  lemmons joined enron in 1992 . most recently , he was the vice - president of  capital structuring and risk management for ees . russ porter joins us today  from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power  origination .  b ) downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena  , s industrial  origination efforts in pulp and paper , petrochemicals and refining ,  environmental energy , metals and mining and other industries as coverage is  established . the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm , jay  boudreaux , finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich . we anticipate announcing  two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks .  c ) generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant  services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups . the senior  members of this team include thomas suffield , andy kelemen , kelly mahmoud and  john house . thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 . most recently , he was the  vice - president of origination for the latin american group in azurix . we  anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few  weeks .  d ) upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer  finance , coal and gas assets groups . the senior members of this team include  brad dunn , john curtin and chris hilgert . we hope to announce the addition  of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend .  ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and  downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary  responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams . andrea reed will  continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management : all junior  commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual  responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the  capital structuring group . the remaining four groups within ctg will remain  largely unchanged . in addition , the origination and the transaction  development teams and their respective origination groups will be located  together .  we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage  and industry knowledge in all ena  , s markets particularly in the industrial  markets . it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between  the coverage / origination groups and the ctg groups .  please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north  america by working with us to implement these changes .",0

"Subject: f / up  sheila ,  i am forwarding you a message i received a few days ago . i want to ask you  for advice how to handle this case .  my first reaction was to ignore it . the longer i think about it , the more  convinced i become that some action  is required .  let ' s try to reverse the situation and assume for the sake of argument that a  female employee  was harassed by a male colleague . an employee informs her boss a few months  later about  the alleged incident and the boss chooses to ignore it . in many similar  cases , courts subsequently  found against the companies that decided to turn a blind eye to such  complaints .  the fact that we are dealing with the case of reverse harassment is  immaterial .  if i ignore this complaint i may expose the company to charges of double  standard in  handling sexual harassment cases .  my recommendation would be to ask maureen to attend sensitivity training and  sexual harassment prevention class .  please , let me know what you think . sorry to burden you with this case .  vince  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by vince j kaminski / hou / ect on 12 / 29 / 2000  11 : 01 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  clayton vernon @ enron  12 / 21 / 2000 03 : 51 pm  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : f / up  vince -  i got your message ( i was up on the roof of the building helping to fix the  weather satellite dish - what a gorgeous view of houston ! ) .  i appreciate your words . everything remains fine , vince . you are my "" father ""  here at enron , and i admire and respect you greatly . i think i know the kind  of person you are , in terms of your integrity , and i admire the high  standards you set for all of us in your extended "" group .

"Subject: enron europe organisational changes  once the arcos plant in spain is financially closed ( expected in q 2 of this  year ) eric gonzales will be moving back to houston to work exclusively on  co - managing enron ' s lng markets . we are very appreciative of eric ' s efforts  in europe since early 1998 and look forward to continuing to work very  closely with his lng team in the coming years . from this point forward eric  will focus his remaining time in europe exclusively on financially closing  arcos .  we are therefore making the following changes immediately . the origination  responsibility for italy will be moved under eric shaw . ricardo bortolloti  will continue in the role as italian country manager and will report to eric  shaw . mariano gentilini will become our country manager for spain and  portugal and will report directly to the enron europe office of the chairman .  the arcos power project is likely to create a large gas to power spread  position and so we have asked paul mead to assume the added responsibility  for our natural gas risk positions in spain . this position is much more  likely to be supplied and influenced by lng rather than continental gas  markets and paul will work quite closely with both enron global markets and  the continental gas team .  ross sankey who has been managing our marketing efforts in holland will also  head a new organization that will focus on subsea interconnector and power  transmission opportunities across europe . among the prospects his team will  pursue include projects from norway to the uk , sweden to the continent ,  and bidding on existing french interconnector capacity . he will report to  eric shaw for the holland markets and to richard lewis for the transmission  responsibilities .  finally the continental gas team is interacting far more with our uk gas team  than our power teams on the continent . therefore david galagher who manages  our continental gas team will now report directly to richard lewis .  we have aggressive income targets for this year and anticipate that these  changes will create the right links to optimize our performance . please help  make these changes as smooth as possible .  john sherriff  michael brown",0

"Subject: california update 4 / 27 / 01  the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please  treat with discretion .  executive summary :  ? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives .  politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis ; from  an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new  power generation  ? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of  out - of - state generators  ? june lst "" kill clause "" for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional  plan  ? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected  $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper  administration involvement  ? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court  ? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling  ? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout  deal  1 . ferc fallout  the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks  like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to  continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to  allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape  shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the  administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the  administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the  forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps  on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the  construction of new generation .  it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were  generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who  favors price caps actually voted against this plan .  2 . something less than effective price caps  from davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws :  ? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west .  non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to  california .  ? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power  than a ceiling .  ? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game  the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2  emergency and does not require any collusion .  ? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the  highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require  wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the  cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc .  3 . proposal "" kill clause "" adds to the political dilemma for davis  the ferc proposal includes a "" kill clause "" that says the caps will be  withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the  regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the  regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines  blaming him for letting the "" bush price caps plan "" collapse .  4 . growing fiscal risk in california  sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion  on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of  pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the  situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take  further action to control prices for power .  the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about  90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to  finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals .  the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge  loans they are providing to california .  the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness  of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will  have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating  deficits in a matter of months .  5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & e  meanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the  bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts ,  since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for  gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the  qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw  of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline .  6 delays likely in new qf generation  the qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being  continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those  contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated .  7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan  harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an  analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a  utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number  of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a  "" non - bypassable "" charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even  if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is  no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be  used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would  be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according  to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private  company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for  the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not  stand a likely constitutional challenge .  8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long - term power contracts  the issue of the governor ' s failure to disclose the details of the long - term  power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis .  even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been  negotiating , it is likely that their actions and negotiations will  challenged , creating an even further delay .",0

 by mike jude and nancy meachim  the terms  & asp  8 and  & ibm  8 may have more in common than being three -  letter acronyms .  remember big blue of the early  + 60 s ? the vision , then , was centralized  computing . mainframe computers hosted complex , expensive applications  that end users accessed via dumb terminals . it infrastructure ,  especially memory , was expensive and needed to be controlled . with  computing resources centralized , ibm reasoned , they were easier to  maintain .  of course , ibm got it wrong , in that computers became a cheap commodity .  and users weren  , t happy simply using dumb terminals . they wanted a  bigger share in all that technology offered . so , as memory prices fell ,  so did the idea of central control . dumb terminals were transformed into  intelligent desktop machines that could store applications and data . the  glass house populated by white - smocked technicians went out of fashion .  looking back on those times , many of us would shake our heads and wonder  how ibm could have been so wrong . but maybe big blue wasn  , t so far off .  thanks to the advent of application service providers , centralized  computing is making a comeback . asps offer centralized application  management .  the market started as a way to offer the benefits of server  advertisement protocol and other complex enterprise resource planning  software to small companies or companies with less technical savvy . but  asps now host all kinds of applications , including small , multilicensed  programs whose images are downloaded to end users on demand . but , the  principle remains the same : central control makes support much more  efficient and usually cheaper . how about that , ibm ?  to be fair , the dynamics of an asp are very different from old  centralized mainframe operations . an asp doesn  , t just host and support  an application for general distribution over an in - house proprietary  network . unlike the ibm vision , an asp is very dependent on network  service . it is also very sensitive to service levels . in the  + 60 s , if  the mainframe let you down , you ended up twiddling your thumbs for an  hour or so , and your only recourse was that white - smocked fellow .  nowadays , users start to scream if service is interrupted for even a  minute . and woe to the asp who brings down a customer operation . the  world of the asp is much more complex than that of the old  + 60 s shop .  however , if one could magically transport a computer user from the  + 60 s  to the wonderful new 2000 s , would it seem all that different to him ? in  an ideal asp world , a la scott mcnealy  , s vision , users would sit down  at a semidumb terminal , download the application du jour , and start  working . what did the  + 60 s user do ? kind of the same thing !  so you are probably wondering , what is the point ? just this : ibm  , s  problem was leaving the customer out of the equation . and look what  happened . customers rebelled . they didn  , t buy ibm  , s spiel . it became  the  & in  8 thing to hate ibm . why ? because the guys in white smocks  couldn  , t spell service and didn  , t care about customers .  to be successful , asps need to learn from the past . they need to tattoo  service on the forehead of each of their employees . there are too many  choices , today , for customers to put up with inferior service . that  , s  one big difference from the  + 60 s . customers now can literally choose  any service provider in the world . just being big doesn  , t cut it these  days .  to contact mike jude and nancy meachim :  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  senior consultant michael jude and research director nancy meachim are  with enterprise management associates in boulder , colo . ,  ( http : / / www . . com ) , a leading analyst and market  research firm focusing exclusively on all aspects of enterprise  management . jude has over 18 years of experience in the  telecommunications industry , most recently with us west , where he was a  manager of public policy . mike can be reached at  mailto : jude @ . com . meachim focuses on e - business  management . she is currently conducting a research study on asp  management that is due to be released in april . nancy ' s email address  is mailto : meachim @ . com .  for related links - - click here for network world ' s home page :  http : / / www . nwfusion . com  buzz : application otsourcing , network world fusion , 09 / 27 / 99  asp research page , network world  all about asps  information center for application service providers , their customers  and delivery partners . includes resources , events and news . the asp  industry consortium .  http : / / www . aspindustry . org /  subscription services  to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters ,  go to :  to change your email address , go to :  subscription questions ?

"Subject: re : henwood query  hi karolina ,  yes , it might be more productive to talk on the phone . given our time  difference , why don ' t we plan on tomorrow ( friday ) 8 : 00 am pdt , 4 : 00 pm bdt ? my  number in the states is 503 - 464 - 8430 . give me your number , too , so that i can  call back if i get hung up in a meeting or something .  the situation is complicated by the fact that the marginal cost is set by the  capacity increment of a plant that is on the margin in a particular hour , but  in constructing the stack , increments of a plant may be scattered throughout  the stack , based on their respective incremental heat rates . ( this is why  increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model . ) results for  the capacity increments , however , are not available as output ; only each  plant ' s aggregate values are reported .  i had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a  homer city , ny plant we were studying a few years ago . attached is the sql  query you can import into ms access to do the same thing for you ( making  appropriate modifications to the year , hour , etc . ) unfortunately , no henwood  documentation on the output variables existed when i created this query , so i  can not really tell you what they represent anymore . an acquaintance of mine  at entergy and i were lobbying to get henwood to provide some documentation ,  so it may be available now .  let ' s talk and maybe we can help you out ,  michael  > > > karolina potter / lon / ect @ enron 08 / 24 / 00 07 : 08 am > > >  michael ,  i am an analyst in paul mead ' s continental power trading group in london . i am  currently working on the project , which requires the use of emss , and  experience some difficulties interpreting the output results . steven leppard  from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and  consequently the person to contact in case of problems .  i have been running simulations for the dutch market and was asked to provide  the traders with some front - end screen graphs in order to interpret the  numerical results . one of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack and  system ' s marginal cost , as we only run cost based scenarios . to sort each  station ' s hourly generation i need its marginal cost . to my knowledge though ,  marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit ( transarea  marginal units query , marg _ cost unit ) . therefore i was sorting the stations  according to the cost which i calculated based on the outputs from station  detail by hour query . the calculation was as follows :  for each hour , for each generating station :  "" marginal cost "" [ o / mwh ] = ( generation _ cost [ oo 00 ] * 1000 ) / generation [ mwh ] -  vom _ cost [ o / mwh ]  this i thought would include fuel cost and start up costs . however , a marginal  station which i get on the stack as a result of the above calculation is not a  station given in marginal station field in transarea marginal units query . i  have also looked into transarea _ data _ hr table and transarea _ data table but non  of the costs there match my results .  do you happen to know what formula is used to determine marg _ cost and which  outputs i should be using to obtain the right results ?  it might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone . in this case  could you please send me your direct telephone number . i am struggling  understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much .  regards  karolina",0

 a ) our conviction of your transparent honesty and  diligence  b ) that you would treat this transaction with utmost  secrecy and confidentiality  c ) that you will not ask for more share or try to  sit on the funds once it is under  your custody , or any form of blackmail .  d ) that upon receipt of the funds you will release  the funds as instructed  by us after you have removed your share of 20 % from  the total amount .  please , note that this transaction is 100 % legal and  risk free and we hope to conclude  this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days  from the date  of receipt of the necessary requirements from you .  we are looking  forward to doing business with you and solicit your  total confidentiality  in this transaction . there is no cause for alarm . i  give you my word that you  are completely safe in doing business with us .  transactions like this  have been successfully carried out in the past by  most government  executives . here in my country there is great  economic and political  disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant  and the order of  the day , thus explaining why you might have heard  stories of how  money is been taken out of nigeria , this is because  everyone is  making desperate attempts to secure his or her  future , so that when  we retire from active service we donot languish in  poverty . i will  explain more to you when i have heard from you .  please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using  the above e - mail address .  i will bring you into the complete picture of this  pending business  transaction when i have heard from you and also  receive your  confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me  fax to you all  necessary information you need to know about our  pending business  transaction . i will also send to you my private  telephone and fax  numbers where you can always reach me . your urgent  response will be  highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds  under the second  quarter of the year 2002 . thank you and god bless .  yours faithfully ,  dr . tom eke .  n . b . please be informed that this business  transaction is 100 % legal  and completely free from drug money or money  laundering . this is a  complete legitimate business transaction .  - -",1

"Subject: california power 1 / 19 / 00  executive summary :  sb - 7 x gives dept . of water and resources given legislative authority to  undertake short - term power purchases with no price cap through feb . 2 nd  new legislation ( ab - 1 x and sb - 6 x ) would seek ( 1 ) long - term contracts with 5 . 5  cent cap and ( 2 ) creation of california power and conservation financing  authority  the long - term contracts proposed in ab - 1 x are likely to be subject to  significant amendment and renegotiation prior to the feb . 2 nd expiration of  sb - 7 x .  the authority proposed in sb - 6 x would have bond issuance powers to finance  new generation capacity and conservation measures  negotiations under way on using bond authority for a utility  bailout - - utilities and state government split over debt obligations of  utility parents  state borrowing plans and power purchases create credit risks for state  treasury ; socal edison misses more payments  bush administration opposes price caps , but is supporting state efforts to  split pg we believe he then could be willing to guarantee or  issue  bonds to deal with the rest .  as one very senior california political leader explained , getting the utility  holding companies to eat a substantial part of the debt they owe themselves  is the key to solving the back debt problem without provoking widespread  public outrage about a "" bailout "" of private price - gouging companies with  taxpayer money . since 75 % of californians currently blame the utilities and  the puc for this crisis ( and only 10 % blame davis ) , this is a crucial  political stance for the governor .  but , of course , absorbing anything like $ 6 billion in debt would be quite a  shock to the seemingly healthy holding company and power - generating branches  of the two utilities , and they began spreading the word that they were quite  willing to accept bankruptcy . thus by mid - week , both  sides had pushed themselves toward a resolution in federal bankruptcy court  that would be a worst case solution for all sides : the country ' s economy  would  suffer from the resulting credit shock , the governor ' s political future would  suffer from the electricity rate increases almost certain to be mandated by a  bankruptcy judge , while most private sector legal authorities believe the  utilities corporate holding structure would ultimately be breached during  bankruptcy  procedures and they would end up having to absorb some significant amount of  the debt in the end . in addition , they would most likely face a state  government  determined to use state powers of condemnation to enter the power business in  a major way .  senator burton ' s sb 6 x legislation will strengthen those powers dramatically  to make this point quite explicit . it would set up a "" california power and  conservation  financing authority , "" with the power to issue bonds and invoke eminent  domain . it would finance new power plants , and "" consider the feasibility and  public  interest of the state acquiring , operating , and maintaining transmission  facilities currently owned by investor - owned and municipal utilities . ""  as we write this , all sides are trying to construct a path back down from the  bankruptcy ledge to safe ground , and there is no question the tone has  shifted  in the last 24 hours from macho confrontation to "" maybe we ' ve run this thing  out as far as we can . "" but as we have noted , the chance for miscalculation is  still quite high . there is no solution agreed to at this time , the stand - off  over how much debt the state government will absorb versus the utilities '  holding  company is continuing , and the technical fact of default still makes it  possible for some bank to trigger bankruptcy by demanding immediate  accelerated payment .  5 . default update - thursday  socal edison - $ 215 million default to california power exchange .  after edison failed to make a $ 215 m electricity payment yesterday , the  california power authority began seizing long - term contacts and reselling  them to recoup some of the money owed to generators . pg & e said it expects  its trading privileges at the cal . power authority to be suspended today ,  leaving them with only its generation from nuclear and hydroelectric sources .  while the ongoing wave of defaults has severely restricted pg & e ' s and socal ' s  ability to buy power , the department of water and resources will be able to  pick up some of the slack , at least in the very short - term .  the state itself may be getting into risky credit territory . the proposed  california public power authority would borrow in the neighborhood of $ 1 . 3  billion from the state general fund in advance of this year ' s expected fiscal  surplus , with the loan to be repaid by the authority from expected future  revenues . with near - bankrupt utilities and a freeze on rate hikes , it is  unclear where the revenues would come from . the amount borrowed and terms of  repayment will be no doubt examined very carefully by the bond rating  agencies .  5 . bush policies  as we reported on wednesday , the bush administration continues to demonstrate  little interest in getting involved in the california crisis .  president - elect bush surprised state leaders yesterday with his comments ,  which essentially said that excessive environmental regulation was the root  of the current supply shortage . bush and his top officials appear to be  unanimously opposed to long - term price caps .  however , there is one issue of considerable importance to the administration ,  according to a source close to a top bush economic advisor . there is  significant concern that pg & e ' s credit problems could cause gas suppliers to  stop shipments of gas through pg & e ' s pipeline . the risk would be that the  pipeline could "" go dry "" , causing significant and possibly dangerous  disruptions in california residences and businesses . to prevent this  problem , bush is working with davis on a proposal to split pg & e into separate  gas and electric companies . the gas company would be solvent , but the  electric company would go immediately into ch . 11 following significant  defaults .",0

"Subject: energy leader consulting generation evaluator ( ege )  shirley :  as requested , herein is information regarding the meeting with vince kaminski .  the presentation on the ege tool ' s applications and the allegheny energy case study is timed to take an hour . if the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for tuesday , may 29 , might i request it be set for late afternoon ( as my other appointments are the next day ) .  and , as vince will recall , i was co - leader of the energy consulting business of phb hagler bailly , and developer of the ramp up , real time , 75 check and electric strategy tools . presently , i am ceo of energy leader consulting ( elc ) .  background  the u . s . power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years . rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively . utilities , who still control most power plants , endeavor to adopt the entrants ' methods . yet , inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread .  utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades - old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling . many utilities , notwithstanding the industry - wide trend towards profit maximization , cling to ingrained routines .  inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale . a utility may operate a relatively small system ( fewer than a dozen plants ) . a small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers , playing the wholesale market at the margin .  for a variety of reasons , utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units , let alone shut down any ( even temporarily or seasonally ) . economically inefficient units continue to be committed , week after week , and run in the half - load range .  ege objectives  ege identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines . taking into account transmission and reliability factors , the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant .  i . an industry participant can use ege as a basis for a medium or long - term wholesale power transaction with a utility ; or to price wholesale power more aggressively , to take market share from the utility ( i . e . , compel changes in unit commitment habits ) .  ii . an industry participant can use ege to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition .  iii . a power plant developer can use ege to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility ' s unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized .  specific ege concepts  ege reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities .  it produces indicative statistics such as :  a . the frequency distribution of starts per week ;  b . the frequency distribution of starts by day / 15 - minute segment during the week ;  c . the frequency distribution of load level ;  d . the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start ;  e . average heat rate and approximate fully - allocated cost in the half - load range ;  f . average ramp rate from the half - load range ;  g . the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours ; and  h . forced - off maintenance outage rate ( where indicated ) .  indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month / year ; in some cases , by temperature range . ( they can be by regional wholesale prices as well . ) ege establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years .  ege is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data . ege is now updated for the 4 th quarter 2000 ( through december 31 , 2000 ) . ege lst quarter 2000 ( through march 31 , 2001 ) will be available approximately june 15 , 2001 .  ege also compares and ranks generating units ' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility ( as well as other regional generators ) . some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half - load level for lengthy time periods ( without an apparent reliability basis ) , splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units .  other ege supporting data :  i . planned maintenance schedule ( where indicated ) ;  j . actual maximum generating capacity ;  k . actual minimum generating capacity ( actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government - reported values ) ;  l . average heat rate in the full - load range ; and  m . average heat rate in the three - quarter - load range .  with respect to a generating units ' average heat rate in the half - load , three - quarter - load and full - load ranges , it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region . it can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities , and changes in recent years in these parameters .  the real - world example of allegheny energy  allegheny energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of ege . in the 4 th quarter 2000 , for instance , one high - cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning ( 52 times ) and committed for the whole day ( in all but two cases ) . arguably , there are power products that could substitute for this routine ( in part at least ) at a profit to the seller of the product and allegheny energy .  another high - cost allegheny energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn ( nine times ) and committed for most of the coming week . at another plant , two high - cost units were operated too often in the expensive half - load range ( some 550 hours ) and three - quarter - load range ( another 400 to 600 hours ) ; they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels . again , there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to allegheny energy .  offering of energy leader consulting ( elc )  ege is a procedure , not a software package or data base . elc believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities .  elc transfers its "" knowledge "" about the ege procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight - forward four - step process :  1 . enron would select one to three target utilities .  2 . elc would perform the ege procedure on the target utilities .  3 . employing this real - world analysis as a pedagogic tool , elc , in a one - day seminar with enron personnel , would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future ( without the assistance of elc ) .  4 . optionally , elc would provide ege supporting data , quarterly , to enron .  the basic ege supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program ( virtually all fossil fuel units ) . parameters that are incorporated , and the data set format , will be specified upon request . custom modifications will be considered .  steven a . mitnick  chief executive officer  energy leader consulting  4807 41 st street , nw  washington , dc 20016  ( 202 ) 997 - 0924 voice  ( 202 ) 537 - 0906 fax  smitnick @ energyleader . com",0

"Subject: organizational changes  changes in enron ' s business require us to reevaluate how we approach the  engineering and construction function within enron . specifically , enron  energy services ' ( ees ) business has grown dramatically and that requires  considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to  develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers .  additionally , in light of enron ' s continued emphasis on increasing our return  on invested capital , we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction  projects around the world . historically , these projects have been a primary  focus of eecc ' s activities . consequently we are making the following  organizational changes concerning eecc :  eecc ' s pipeline construction group , led by jerry martin , will become part of  enron transportation services .  nepco will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant  construction services to enron entities and third parties .  the remainder of eecc will become part of ees . larry izzo will report to the  ees office of the chairman .  these changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth  opportunities within enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our  employees . please join us in supporting and implementing these changes .",0
"Subject: henwood stuff and thoughts about valuation  did you guys get this ?  i was too interested in the conversation to interrupt with comments about  risk / return if the decision would be covered in rates , it is the  customers ' curves or equivalently the puc ' s curve .  i think if i were going to approach valuation in commodities where the  assumptions of black / scholes do not apply , i would start with the capm for  large industries in an area , use pro formas to translate this to utility  curves for the input commodities , and add the utility curves .  another issue : the factor that explains why enron is lowest bidder is its  role in the market . in the 1930 s , keynes argued that if most market  participants with long position were hedgers , futures prices would be higher  than spot ; if they were speculators or traders , future prices would be lower  than spot . traders must be compensated for holding the risk ; hedgers  ( including utilities and consumers ) are willing to pay a premium for the  certainty . consequently , enron traders have bigger bid / ask spreads and lower  bid prices .  just some random thoughts ,  michael  - - - - - original message - - - - -  date : 01 / 04 / 2001 10 : 41 am ( thursday )  from : "" heather mason ""  to : hq 3 . em 5 ( michael schilmoeller )  mark your calendar - tuesday january 23 , 2001 downtown houston hyatt hotel  henwood will be hosting a comprehensive ercot symposium on tuesday , january  23 , 2001 . a team of henwood regional power market specialists will be  presenting the latest analysis and  information to assist you in preparing for the new ercot restructured power  market , in addition to an anlysis of the issues now playing out in the wscc  markets . coffee and registration will  begin at 9 : 30 am and the program will run until 3 : 00 pm . lunch and snacks  will be provided .  agenda topics include :  * what will be the critical - success factors for qualified scheduling entities  operating in ercot ' s new wholesale & retail markets ?  * how will market restructuring impact mid to long - term wholesale prices ?  * what is the outlook for new generation ?  * what are the impacts of upcoming emission regulations on ercot ' s generation  resources ?  * what are the new analytical tools available to capture market uncertainty  impacts to your supply contracts and generation assets ?  * what are the restructuring lessons learned from the california experience  and the implications to ercot ?  in conjunction with this program , henwood will have a demonstration room  available to present its latest software applications and e - business  solutions . a nominal $ 75 registration fee is required  to reserve a space in the workshop .  for more information or to reserve your spot , please contact heather mason at  henwood : hmason @ hesinet . com or 916 / 569 - 0985 .  about henwood : henwood offers integrated business solutions , strategic  consulting , and innovative e - business applications to meet the challenges of  the restructured energy markets throughout  north america , australia , and europe , serving clients that include eight of  the ten top utilities in north america , in addition to energy services  providers and power marketers .",0

 2 ) volatility : i found winston ' s examples on this metric succinct . i would  recommend that in future years you dedicate some hours of class time to this  subject . my criticism again relates to messy problems . i anticipate  arguments  against real option applications based on the dispute of volatility  measures .  if i were a conservative financial manager , i would argue that :  * * * two - a : implied volatility derived from an industry specific slice of  equity  options is a shotgun approach - - the projects being valued are of a tranche  which may in fact have a significantly different outcome variance than the  weighted average measured by the equities utilized . oil , gas and electricty  are  good examples the major players are competing on many different levels of  the  value chain . smaller companies do exist which are dedicated to one strata ,  but  what about projects that want to exploit opportunies across strata in a  vertically integrated company ?  * * * two - b : based on the following skepticism - if a real option value is  being  proposed for a new business venture ( some new unexploited opportunity , )  there is  some paradox embedded in the increased value based on high volatility in new  ventures and the high risk of failure . this skepticism is likely to be less  acute in high - tech sectors where the huge upside of new ventures is paraded  before us daily by nasdq touts . it is a much harder sell to "" mature ""  industries .  of particular interest in the power industry are investments centered around  opportunities arising from restructuring of electricity and natural gas  sectors  as regulation is removed . a large proportion of the risk is embedded in  ongoing  changes of public policy on an international basis . as an intentionally  screwed - up example , can anyone other than a financial genius correctly asses  volatility for u . s . companies investing in seed projects in mexico based on  speculation of the inevitable dismantling of the national utility ( cfe ) and  pemex ?

"Subject: re : steve leppard  dale ,  my recommendation is to make steve the head of the research unit in london .  we were talking originally about september but i think we should accelerate  this process .  of course , anjam will be very unhappy about it , but we cannot manage around  him  any longer .  i think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase .  i would like to offer him a significant increase that  goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility .  a salary increase will also bring him closer to the market .  we see the market for technical people going through the roof in  practically every location  where we operate .  a contract is not a good solution in my view . it creates a sense of false  security for  both an employee and the company .  i shall send a message to john sherriff with my recommendation . i shall cc  you .  i would appreciate if you could bring it up with john as well .  vince  dale surbey  07 / 11 / 2000 10 : 23 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : steve leppard  hi vince ,  hr is working on a mid - year salary review for london people that have a  noticeable gap between their compensation at enron and what we would have to  pay in the market for a replacement . they highlighted steve as someone with  a potential gap - particularly in light of what we ' re seeing in our quant  recruiting effort for credit trading and research .  i ' d like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep steve happy and  keep him at enron . there are several things i see we can do :  1 ) give him a mid - year pay increase to move him closer to market . i ' m not  sure this is the best way to go , especially if we only offer him a token  salary increase .  2 ) offer him more responsibility : what are your thoughts on timing for  making steve the official head of the london research team ? with my move to  ebs , should we accelerate this ? i think this is good way to keep him happy  and motivated , and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at  year - end ( as part of the regular process ) that takes into account his greater  responsibility .  3 ) we have some people that we ' re trying to get under long - term ( 3 - yr )  contract with a 12 - month notice clause . obviously anyone signing one of  these will want significant up - front compensation for being handcuffed .  we ' ve not had a lot of success with these here in london , and i would prefer  to keep steve happy so he wants to stay with enron rather than contractually  binding him to the job .  i ' d value your thoughts on this .  thanks ,  dale",0

"Subject: energy finance critiques  david ,  here are the reviews of the ut energy finance program that you requested :  from jennifer martinez ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of  1998 ) :  the energy finance program 2 years ago was very good , especially considering  it was the first year of the program . there were a lot of guest speakers  from various energy companies who gave us a lot of practical knowledge about  the energy industry through case studies , lectures , etc . basically , we  learned all the same finance concepts and tools as in the regular finance  classes , but all the cases and examples were energy - related . the professors  were good for the most part but didn ' t have a great deal of practical  industry experience . if i had to guess the reason for decreased  participation in the program , i would probably say it is the professors .  ronn and titman are great but known as being very technical and  quantitative . some students prefer less technical professors and classes  that aren ' t limiting to the energy industry . also , the fact that the class  meets for 3 hours twice a week may not be so appealing . other than those  things , i can ' t imagine why there has been such a drop in enrollment . i  especially don ' t understand why every single person didn ' t drop for enron . i  wonder if it has something to do with international status . ? ? ?  from john massey ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of 1998 ) :  bottom line -  ut business schools is great - investment fund - best activity available to  students  energy finance program - fairly weak -  it was a watered down version of the futures options class crossed with a  weak finance appendage -  the finance teacher was pathetic - both a poor teacher , ignorant about  industry specific analysis , devoid of industry experience , rude to outside  lectures ( from industry )  keith brown was the only educator that was any good and he only had a small  portion of the class time -  way to make better :  get teachers with practical industry experience -  make it a seminar class - focus on case studies , lectures - given by people  from industry -  promote the class within the business school - i felt like ut did a poor job  of internally ( to students ) promoting the class -  - - - - - - - - - - -  from ross mesquita ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of 1998 ) :  to be honest , a great majority of the coursework was not energy specific .  when energy applications were presented , it seemed more like general finance  questions were reworded to include energy lingo . we had some very good  speakers , but for the most part , i did not feel like the 6 hours of class had  enough energy focus . i assumed that this would get better as the program  progressed .  one reason that may account for the decline in enrollment is that energy  finance is a very specific focus . i would have probably not enrolled in the  energy finance program had it been available in my first year . i did not  know enough about energy at that time and i had returned to b - school to  consider several career options - - i . e . , investment banking , corporate  finance , entrepreneurship , marketing , etc . as a new mba student , i would not  want to narrow my window of opportunities to only energy companies .  here is my perspective and probably something that is true of many mbas - -  my interest in enron brought me to the energy industry and not vice versa .  - - - - - - - - - -  from billy braddock ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of 1998 ) :  i was a participant in the inaugural energy finance program in the fall of  1998 . the primary positives to the class revolved around outside  panels / instruction . for example , enron sent representatives on 2 separate  occasions to discuss particular topics ( vince kaminski and gary hickerson ) .  other notable speakers were jeff sandefer ( independent business consultant  and e & p professional ) , the beacon group , and encap investments . another good  speaker was a professor from ut ' s school of engineering . he brought a good  perspective as to the "" basics "" of the energy business .  the class was structured via a team - based instruction approach , with 3  professors team - teaching a 6 - hour credit course . none of the 3 professors  had any product knowledge of the energy business . of the 3 professors , 2  were research focussed / tenured with little credibility in "" teaching . "" one of  the professors primary focus of research was fixed income , while the other 2  were investments and corporate finance , respectively .  as is the case for ut ' s finance program in general , and energy finance in  particular , ut is in dire need of teaching professors ( as opposed to research  professors ) that have the ability to convey finance with practical examples  and at a level that can be more easily be understood by students without a  finance background . particular to the energy program , ut needs to have more  instruction from energy professionals ( such as the instructors used for  enron ' s internal learning programs ( ie . derivatives classes , etc . ) .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  from bryan williams ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of 1998 ) :  i participated in the first energy finance class offered in fall of 1998 , at  the university of texas .  the curriculum was understandably  & rough around the edges  8 as 1998 was the  first year the energy finance course was offered . however , the instruction  also suffered as none of the instructors had any energy background to speak  of ( the 6 - credit hour class was team taught by three tenured professors ) .  two of the three professors have co - authored textbooks , and the third  professor  , s claim to fame is fixed income . as a group , the three professors  are research - heavy ( as opposed to industry focused ) , and the team - teaching  format did not incent any one of the profs to be personably accountable for  the success of the class .  that said , the instructors did a good job attracting some top notch outside  speakers . among them : vince  kaminski & gary hickerson , both of enron . they also dedicated one class  period to a video conference call with the beacon group , an energy consulting  group that i believe was recently acquired by goldman .  jeff sandefer , an independent businessman , an entreprenuership instructor ,  and one of the foremost experts in the e  - there are some experienced , brand - name professors ( e . g . sheridan titman )  teaching in the program ;  cons :  - the program should give the students more exposures to energy companies  such as enron . specifically , it might need to help students link to the  interview oppurtunites from these energy companies such as enron ;  from george huan ( mba class of 2000 , energy finance taken fall of 1999 ) :  companies expect mba students to have both general management ( new ideas ) and  analytic ( quantative ) skills . energy industry is no exception .  energy finance program offers financial strategy and risk managements courses  which fit in the insudtry need . however , these two courses are far from  enough to help students understand the dynemic of industrial transformation  and excitements and opportunities in this industry . other management and  quantitive courses are needed to complete this program .  my suggestions :  1 ) seminars or lectures about energy industry and energy companies . before  students make their decisions , let them know : what ' s happening and what ' s  going to happen in this industry ; what the companies are doing now ; who  they are looking for .  2 ) management and / or analytical courses should be included . such as :  strategy , financial enginering and real option .  3 ) more industry connections . presentations and discussions .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  from charlie weldon ( mba class of 2000 , energy finance taken in fall of 1999 )  my experience in the energy finance program overall was a positive  experience . the most rewarding part of the class was the guest speakers  brought in during dr . titman ' s portion of the class . this part of the course  is taught in the second half of the semester and consisted of ~ 10 case  classes all focusing on the energy industry . two of the cases were based on  enron , and overall the case selection in my opinion was very appropriate and  well thought out . value added by the professor was less than from the  speakers and cases .  the first eight weeks of the course covered futures and options . nearly all  of the examples and problems discussed pertained directly to the energy  industry and special emphasis was placed on increasing the student ' s  understanding of the supply and demand dynamics in the power market . the use  of options and futures for speculating and / or hedging was stressed on  numerous occasions and a decent attempt at explaining how to value a power  plant project .  i believe that the university energy finance faculty are trying to  continuously make improvements to the program . however , i do not believe  that they are moving fast enough or necessarily down the right path to  improvement . there is a strong need for more practical based training on  energy derivatives similar to the course taught by paradigm here at enron .  the focus of the university teachers is quite theoretical , due in large part  to their background . while the theoretical basis is crucial to understanding  the basics , the real value of such a program in my opinion is the effective  bridging of the theoretical with the practical all in one course .  until measures are taken to inject practicality from someone with extensive  industry experience , i believe the energy finance program will continue to  underdeliver on its objectives . additionally , i believe that the course  structure should be changed to eliminate the need of having 3 consecutive  hours of classroom instruction .",0

"Subject: re : backtesting for different percentiles  vlady , i enclosed the file with 2 backtesting plots ( you saw them before ) .  the following table shows what was the percentage of the days when pnl fell  below var 95 , var 90 , var 85 .  these results are based on the real ng forward prices from 1 / 1 / 99 to 6 / 7 / 00  for 2 different portfolios :  - portfolio 1 contained the positions equal to ng - price - prc portfolio  positions on 6 / 6 / 00 ,  - portfolio 2 consists of the positions equal to storage - prc positions on  5 / 25 / 00 .  portfolio 1  var 95 var 90 var 85  implied vols 2 . 93 4 . 11 5 . 57  historical vols with decay = 1 7 . 62 12 . 02 15 . 54  historical vols withdecay = 0 . 97 6 . 75 12 . 02 15 . 54  historical vols withdecay = 0 . 94 6 . 45 12 . 02 15 . 54  portfolio 2  var 95 var 90 var 85  implied vols 4 . 1 6 . 74 9 . 97  historical vols with decay = 1 7 . 04 11 . 14 15 . 84  historical vols withdecay = 0 . 97 6 . 74 10 . 56 16 . 13  historical vols withdecay = 0 . 94 7 . 04 11 . 14 15 . 84  this shows that when we have more observations ( columns corresponding to  var 90 and var 85 )  compared to the column corresponding to var 95 the frequency of curve shift  being lower than var  becomes closer to the theoretical value ( 5 % , 10 % and 15 % ) . the numbers in the  column "" var 85 "" are  very close to 15 % . this is the argument in favor of using historical vols .  and also the results do not depend on the decay factor in this experiment .  also notice : the numbers in column "" var 95 "" are higher than 5 % and this is an  indication of fat tails .  let me know if you have any questions .  tanya .",0

 by phil hochmuth  so far this year , the buzz about linux in enterprise networks has  focused on servers and embedded systems , with the growth of linux  severs being most heralded . according to idc , a research firm based in  framingham , mass . , linux was the fastest - growing server operating  system last year , with a 93 % growth rate over the year before . linux  was the second most - shipped operating system in 1999 after windows nt ,  capturing 24 % of new licenses shipped .  as for the embedded market , linux has emerged as an ideal platform for  network appliances , because the system can be modified to handle  specialized , dedicated tasks very well . companies such as cobalt  networks , picazo and progressive systems have announced linux - based  appliances , ranging from web servers to pbxs to firewalls .  but what of the open source hacker  , s dream of  & linux on every desktop ?  8  sure , linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever , with  colorful , shrink - wrapped boxes of caldera , red hat and corel linux now  available at places like compusa . however , analysts have said that  linux  , s growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro and micro  areas of network servers and embedded operating systems .  according to idc , linux currently runs on only 4 % of u . s . desktops . the  hold microsoft windows has on the desktop market will remain strong ,  analysts say , despite such factors as microsoft  , s antitrust problems  and the surging popularity of linux .  even some linux executives are skeptical of their product  , s desktop  future . recently , suse ceo roland dyroff downplayed linux  , s future on  desktops . dyroff said ,  & given the lack of applications available , we  really can ' t claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet .  8  a recent survey by survey . com gives more hope for linux desktops .  according to the survey of 1 , 640 enterprise network managers , open  source operating systems are used on 10 % of desktops , with the number  jumping to a surprising 23 % of enterprise desktops by 2002 .  despite the mix of numbers being thrown around , two important factors  that will determine the success of linux as an enterprise client  desktop are : a standardized , easy - to - use graphical user interface ( gui )  and available applications .  one company that is working to make linux more user friendly is palo  alto - based eazel , which is designing a next - generation file management  system and user interface to run on top of the linux kernel . according  to eazel  , s web site , the company  , s goal is to bring linux to the masses  and  & do it in a way that appeals to today ' s linux users and to mere  mortals .  8  the company was founded by a group of former apple executives , and is  allied with the gnome project , which has been doing extensive linux  desktop environment development for several years . eazel is due to have  a product out by the middle of this year . with an intuitive , icon - based  file management environment , eazel is hoping its user interface will be  an improvement over the two current linux guis , gnome and kde , and will  help standardized the look and feel of linux for  & regular  8 users . for  enterprise mangers who have already embraced linux on the server side ,  this development will be worth keeping an eye on .  on the applications side , several office productivity suites have been  available for some time , such as sun  , s staroffice suite and koffice for  the kde desktop . corel has also ported its office products , such as  wordperfect , over to linux to complement its own distribution of the  operating system . while there have been recent rumors ( started by linux  care vice president arthur tyde ) that microsoft is working on a port of  ms office to linux , microsoft officials deny this .  while linux may never supplant windows as the industry - standard desktop ,  there should be plenty of opportunity for linux pcs in enterprise nets  in the future .  to contact phil hochmuth :  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  phil hochmuth is a writer and researcher for network world , and a former  systems integrator . you can reach him at mailto : phochmut @ nww . com .  for related links - - click here for network world ' s home page :  http : / / www . nwfusion . com  staroffice software from sun  http : / / www . sun . com / staroffice  corel linux os  http : / / www . corel . com / freedom / freedom . htm  eazel  http : / / www . eazel . com  gnome - - the gnu network object model environment  http : / / www . gnome . org  koffice - - the integrated office suite for kde , the k desktop  environment  http : / / koffice . kde . org /  cobalt networks , inc .  http : / / www . cobaltnetworks . com  progressive systems  http : / / www . progressive - systems . com  picazo  http : / / www . picazo . com  other linux - related articles from network world :  active directory upgrade requires strong game plan , network world ,  03 / 13 / 00  subscription services  to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters ,  go to :  to change your email address , go to :  subscription questions ?

"Subject: sddp model  john ,  attached is a copy of the sddp methodology manual , written by the  developers . the model was developed by mario pereira , who is the proprietor  of psri ( power systems research inc ) in rio de janeiro . their web site is :  www . psr - inc . com where you can find more information about the company and  contact details . mario and most of the staff speak english , so phone calls  are possible .  development of sddp was originally done on a world bank contract to compare  the benefits of new generation and transmission system interconnections in  central america . it has since found much wider application . the code runs  on a pc , and is licensed to a number of consultants , power companies , etc .  while i was with ecnz in wellington , new zealand , we purchased a copy around  1994 .  the model works with weekly or monthly time steps , with a time horizon of  from 1 to 10 years , for mid to long range planning of hydro thermal power  systems . it represents loads in each period as from one to five load blocks ,  so it is not a chronological model . this type of model can not handle  thermal plant ramp rates and similar chronological system constraints . i ' m  not sure how important that would be to you . the optimization phase of the  model takes into account hydrological uncertainty using a form of stochastic  dynamic programming with sampling . this phase sets up a function for water  value in each large reservoir in the system . the simulation phase uses a  number of hydrological outcomes to collect statistics on how the system would  operate . the water values can be used with the short term optimization mode  of sddp or in some other more detailed short term optimization model .  most constraints found in hydro systems can be modelled . many transmission  constraints can be modelled . a dc load flow option can be used to determine  bus nodal prices .  a visual basic user interface is provided which reads and writes text files .  if you ' d like to know more about sddp , you could call me here in houston .

"Subject: data for moody ' s riskcalc  craig and kim ,  as you know , i have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to moody ' s riskcalc .  you wanted to know if it makes sense for enron to purchase riskcalc .  well , after plowing through their 100 page manual and sitting through today ' s 2 - hour moody ' s presentation , it is necessary for us to have information about enron ' s counterparties to move to the next step with riskcalc .  we have obtained some information on enron ' s european counterparties from our colleagues in the london office .  we need for you and / or your colleagues in the houston office to supply us with a list of enron ' s north american counterparties .  more specifically , to evaluate moody ' s riskcalc we will need the following financial inputs for enron ' s north american ( private firm ) counterparties :  fiscal year  the prior twelve months of financial data are represented . annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables , such as cost of goods sold , net income , sales , and ebit . the value should be a four - digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or 2000 . forecasts until the year 2009 can be made . a constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last year ' s ( 1999 ) inflation level . in general this ' estimation error ' will not cause any great problems , as size affects default rates at very large scales ( e . g . , $ 10 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 000 , 000 makes a significant difference , $ 1 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 050 , 00 does not ) .  cash & equivalents  this measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities .  inventory  inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet , in thousands dollars , without any alterations for accounting method ( e . g . , lifo , fifo , average cost ) . this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue . specifically this would include purchase cost , sales cost , sales taxes , transportation costs , insurance costs , and storage costs .  current assets  this item primarily represents cash , inventories , accounts receivables , marketable securities , and other current assets .  total assets  total assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars . for example , $ 15 , 500 , 000 should be entered as 15500 . specifically , total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property , plant , and equipment plus other noncurrent assets ( including intangible assets , deferred items , and investments and advances ) . leave previous year ' s total assets blank for australian companies .  current liabilities  liabilities are positive values . included in current liabilities are short - term debt , accounts payable , and other current liabilities .  total liabilities  this balance sheet account , total liabilities , is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long - term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities ( including deferred taxes , investment tax credit , and minority interest ) .  retained earnings  retained earnings , a historical measure of performance , is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders . typically , it is the prior year ' s retained earnings plus net income less distributions . retained earnings are generally positive . some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings . leave this field blank for australian companies .  sales  this item consists of the industry segment ' s gross sales ( the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period ) reduced by cash discounts , trade discounts , and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers .  cost of goods sold  entered in thousands of dollars , this value is generally a positive number less than sales . it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production , such as material , labor , and overhead . not fixed overhead or items that would be included in selling , general , and administrative expenses . leave this field blank for australian companies .  ebit  earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation . it can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income .  interest expense  this item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short - and long - term debt . typically , we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities . one measure of computing this is : interest expense = 0 . 07 * total liabilities .  net income  this item represents the income ( or loss ) reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations . a loss is represented by a negative sign . for example , a $ 5 , 000 , 000 loss would be entered as - 5000 . leave previous year ' s net income blank for australian companies .  extraordinary items  positive or negative , this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement . the items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations . these items include extraordinary gains / losses , income ( loss ) from discontinued operations , and cumulative affect of accounting changes . expenses are entered as negative values , gains as positive values . leave previous year ' s extraordinary items blank for australian companies .  country  this model is calibrated for the united states , canada , and australia .  we look forward to receiving this information for enron ' s private firm north american counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the evaluation of riskcalc .  thanks ,  iris",0

"" this new market standard should put into place the necessary market  improvements more quickly and at a reduced cost than if we were to implement a  customized market system for new england , "" said william w . berry , chairman and  acting ceo of iso new england . "" now is the time to stop the experimentation .  ultimately , we hope the standard market design will serve as the benchmark for  wholesale electricity marketplaces across the country , if not around the  world .

"" along  with the progress in the implementation of the pjm west concept , this  initiative  will provide an even broader standardized market design .

"Subject: gas prices  vince -  1 . we can detect "" hoarding "" of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against  the actual inflow .  2 . we can detect "" market power "" by dissociating the seller from the buyer ,  distinguishing between the physical "" cost "" in gas to run the generators and  the transmission cost in dollars , i . e . the basis .  3 . ( as you noted ) we can detect "" storage "" as the difference between inflow  and consumption .  it appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model  of gas prices : flow rates at interconnects ( from telemetry ) and spot - market  prices . there is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing  capacity , as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts . the dynamics of gas  prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for  the weather , as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors :  hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas . we can "" calibrate "" the  price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage , and the price  elasticities of demand for transmission , as well as the extent of hoarding ,  from the two sets of numbers mentioned : flows and prices . what the basis  trader needs to understand are the incentives , and disincentives , for storage  and capacity - hoarding , in terms of the calibrated price - elasticities , and  each of these are as - if exotic call options at the consumption hub . finally ,  flows are "" explained "" by the model , and can be imputed from prices if  necessary , resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of  the weather .  i believe the problem is quite tractable , and i would like to proceed with a  model .  clayton",0

"Subject: business partnership ( urgent / confidential )  mr . vincent nnaji ,  standard trust bank ltd ,  lagos , nigeria .  dear sir ,  i am mr . vincent nnaji , bank manager of standard trust bank , lagos , nigeria . i have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you .  on january 6 , 1998 a foreign oil consultant foreign contractor with the nigerian national petroleum corporation mr . james herbert made a numbered time fixed deposit for twelve calendar months valued at us $ 20 m ( twenty million united states dollars ) in my branch .  upon maturity i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . after a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the nigerian national petroleum corporation that mr . james herbert died from an automobile accident .  on further investigation , i found out that he died without making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr . james herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank . this sum of us $ 20 m has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe - keeping . no one will ever come forward to claim it .  according to nigerian law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund . consequently my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money i deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as i tagged them to be photographic materials for export i am writing you because i as a public servant i cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $ 1 m .  i want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney . all these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man ' s labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials .  this is simple . i will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes . the money will be shared in the ratio of 70 % for me and 25 % for you and 5 % will take care of all expenses .  there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction . if you are interested , please reply immediately via my private email address .  upon your response i shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction . please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country .  awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest .  thanks and regards ,  mr . vincent nnaji .",1

( f - pcr ) technology uses live animal blood to detect the presence of infectious diseases and for the development of vaccines for such blood born diseases . it also allows for the efficient , effective , and continuous testing , management and treatment of animal populations . these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds . our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals , but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines .  to date , genethera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease , a disease affecting elk and deer in north america . diagnostic assays for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease are in the final stages of development . vaccines for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease , both of which are diseases affecting cattle , are in advanced stages of development . in the future , the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases / animals , the immediate targets being mad cow , hoof mouth , west nile and newcastle .  genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e . d . r . f . gene sequence . the e . d . r . f . gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human . the patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow ( bse ) in cattle , cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld - jacobs in humans  the company ' s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost . the test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f - pcr , dna analyzing robotics equipment . genethera can analyze over 2000 blood samples a day with one f - pcr machine and a single technician . the project will prove highly profitable at approx $ 4 . 00 per test when wide scale commercialization is under way .  a multi - billion dollar , international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe .  japan conducted 3 million post - mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone . they used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio - rad ' s rapid test . costs are between $ 20 and $ 40 dollars per test . most importantly , other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed . testing through post - mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly .  japan spent between $ 60 million - $ 120 million on 3 million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in 2004 .  genethera ' s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system . the sample is then mailed to the lab for testing . the company also stated in their recent 10 k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs of commercializing our live animal mad cow test .  management :  dr . tony milici -

"Subject: the lure of the san  network world fusion focus : amy larsen decarlo  on storage in the enterprise  today ' s focus : the lure of the san  03 / 14 / 00  dear wincenty kaminski ,  today ' s focus : the lure of the san  by amy larsen decarlo  e - business is changing how businesses value information . information  has become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their  market rivals . companies use intelligence to identify new markets and  make contact with prospective customers . in this media - saturated era ,  information itself is packaged and sold as a product . this makes the  ability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a  continuous basis absolutely crucial .  companies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage  implementations . with estimates for internet storage capacity needs  doubling every three months , it professionals are hungry for a scalable  solution to help them consolidate control of stored information . they  often look to storage - area networks ( san ) as a better option to manage  their information storage systems than distributed models .  today , most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses  file servers to process i / o requests from end users and other  application servers . in this model , all requests for data go through  the file server that owns the attached storage disks , and only one file  server can tap data on a particular disk via a scsi bus .  this model has several shortcomings . first , the amount of data a  server can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the  bus , which limits the capacity of a single file server . second , because  the server processes each i / o request , it risks becoming a bottleneck .  third , this server model carries some daunting availability limitations ,  because only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks . if  that file server or any of its scsi connections fails , then users and  other application servers lose access to the stored files .  this model carries other major disadvantages . distributed file servers  rely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations  which can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a  crawl . finally , this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from  both a logical and a physical perspective . file server based storage  systems are distributed throughout the enterprise , so it is often  difficult to assess current and future capacity needs . and because  these servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to  the disk array , they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage .  sans promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file  servers , largely through consolidation of control . these specialized  storage networks claim higher availability , faster performance ,  centralized management , and by their architecture , the capability to  remove bandwidth - intensive data backup and recovery operations from the  lan . this frees up the lan for normal data communications and ensures  smoother back - up operations .  using high - speed transports like fibre channel , sans offer a high -  performance network optimized for moving storage data . sans also make  way for new storage implementations like lan - free backup . and , because  fibre channel can support distances of up to 10 kilometers , san devices  can be widely distributed , but also centrally managed as one network .  yet , as was the case with lans in their younger years , sans are still  developing . vendors are still working out major product interoperability  issues , while companies deploying san technology struggle with how to  merge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both  together . ultimately the hope is that , like lans , sans will develop into  a mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial  benefits at lower costs .  given that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total 10  times the acquisition price for the equipment , the consolidated  management capabilities of a san may deliver the biggest benefit to  business .  to contact amy larsen decarlo :  -

"Subject: re : stressing correlations  hi , everybody ,  following up on our discussions on stressing correlations i made a  spreadsheet and a dll .  here is what it does :  in the input ( "" main "" sheet ) the user has to specify :  - the size of the correlation matrix ;  - the row and column for the element he wants to stress ( row = 1 and col = 3 in  the example )  - the integer number n _ iter ;  - the original correlation matrix .  in the output ( see sheet "" results "" ) we see 2 columns :  - the first column contains possible correlation values ( from - 1 to 1 ,  n _ iter + 1 numbers ) for the element ( 1 , 3 ) ,  - the second column contains the smallest eigenvalue for the "" stressed ""  correlation matrix  ( which is the same as the original matrix except the elements ( 1 , 3 ) and ( 3 , 1 )  which take values from - 1 to 1 ) .  thus , the user can see which values for the chosen element ( 1 , 3 ) are  permitted  ( those for which the smallest eigenvalue is positive ( marked green in the  example ) .  the user might decide that he wants to assign the correlation which is "" not  permitted "" to this particular element  ( the smallest eigenvalue is negative ) . then the user might have a few options :  1 . all the elements of the correlation matrix will be modified so that the  chosen element has the  desired correlation in it , but the change in the correlation matrix is the  "" smallest "" possible  ( in the sense of matrix norm ) ( this is my next step to do for this  spreadsheet ) .  2 . just one column ( and the corresponding row , of course ) will change , while  the rest of the matrix  will stay unchanged ( kevin ' s suggestion ) . in this case the user have to  choose which column ( and row )  he prefers to modify ( in my example - column - row 1 or column - row 3 ) .  we can discuss this approach with risk control and see how they like it . i  send you only the spreadsheet with an example now .  tanya .",0

"" for the insurance buyer , such exchange  instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle , but  as long as they are quantifiable and indexable , they may represent a  good surrogate , "" he said .  the exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for  over - the - counter securitized deals , if there are regular issuers of  catastrophe bonds , mr . lane said .  the soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of  exchange - based insurance products , said sean f . mooney , senior  vp and chief economist at guy carpenter & co . , the reinsurance  brokerage unit of marsh inc . in new york .  "" the traditional market has been so competitive that people are not  looking for other ways of doing business , "" he said .  at least in concept , the exchange - based deals are generally similar  to the mortgage - backed securities that have been a huge success  since they were introduced in the 1970 s . "" there is a belief that  alternative means of transferring risks will grow , but it is difficult to  predict when , "" mr . mooney said .  currently , the trading that is taking place typically involves  established insurers and reinsurers , so the exchanges have not  brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace , he said .  guy carpenter provided the index for the bermuda commodities  exchange reinsurance products . the bce did not take off ,  however , and was suspended last year after two years of little  activity .  the oldest of the insurance - related , exchange - based derivative  products are the catastrophe options traded on the chicago board  of trade , which began trading the options in 1996 .  initially , there was substantial interest in the options , but the soft  traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge  catastrophe exposures , said carlton purty , an independent broker  at the cbot who trades in options .  no catastrophe option trades have been completed at the cbot  so far this year , he said . last year , there was increased interest in  the contracts because of hurricane floyd , but few contracts were  traded , mr . purty said .  "" i think a major , major catastrophe will have to happen before they  really take off , "" he said .  the contracts offer real protection , and options dealers are keen to  trade in a new niche , but the conventional insurance and reinsurance  markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative  coverage options , mr . purty said .  the catastrophe risk exchange , located in princeton , n . j . , has  radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in  mid - 1996 , and it is well positioned to expand , said frank sweeney ,  chief operating officer .  catex initially planned to be a computer - based facility for  reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks  and to build balanced portfolios .  but by the time the exchange was operational in november 1996 , it  was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in catex  wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance , mr . sweeney  said .  although there was some interest in risk swapping , only a handful of  risks were posted on the system , and none was traded , mr .  sweeney said .  consequently , catex has become chiefly a "" cash for cover ""  exchange , he said , noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange  include property catastrophe coverage , aviation and liability  coverages . catex also trades industry loss warranties , where  coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry  loss over an agreed threshold .  other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible  through the internet in november 1998 . and late last year , catex  offered users the ability to set up smaller networks , allowing them  form groups whose members do business only with one another .  since its inception , catex has completed about 450 trades ,  totaling $ 400 million in premium and more than $ 3 billion in limits ,  he said . catex ' s roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers ,  insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their  captives , mr . sweeney said .  "" we obviously have a long way to go , but we are pretty satisfied  with what we have achieved so far , "" mr . sweeney said .  the exchange sees increased activity after major losses , as cedents  seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their  existing cover , he said . for example , mr . sweeney said , there was  a flurry of activity after the european windstorms in december last  year .  last september , the chicago mercantile exchange entered the field  of insurance - related derivatives when it began offering weather  derivatives .  thus far , 420 futures contracts have been traded , said larry  grannan , senior director in product marketing at the cme .  such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against  weather - related losses . for example , a utility may sell less power in  a mild winter , and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a  resultant fall in revenues .  the exchange first offered heat - based indexes for atlanta , chicago ,  cincinnati and new york . in january , it added philadelphia , dallas ,  des moines , las vegas , tucson and portland , and it began offering  contracts based on cold weather .  currently , most of the trades are between securities dealers  themselves , but , eventually , the contracts will likely be used more  extensively by utilities and insurers , mr . grannan said .  in addition , the futures contracts could be used as hedges for  over - the - counter securitized deals , he said .  copyright , 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .",0

"Subject: status  vasant -  i hope you had a wonderful vacation back home , and are rested and recovered  from the long flight back .  i wanted to give you an update of the eol project , the gas model , and of my  intentions here at enron .  software ( in compiled c on the unix platform ) has been developed and debugged  to listen to the eol trades , process them , book them , and file them away . in  addition , software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on  a continual basis , and to store the entirety of open positions on eol in a  dynamic matrix facilitating analysis . it has yet to get back with me on how  the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit  purposes .  these data files are stored in a format for reading by excel or by sas , for  which i have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines  elucidating the structure of the data .  i am in the process of documenting all of this for you .  with regards the gas model and its slow performance on the compaq , dell has  agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the compaq , to see if  the performance issue of the lp is related to the compaq . i have been  researching this issue with it here and with compaq and dell . the new machine  will be here any day now ( no financial obligation to anyone ) , and i will be  able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is  compaq - specific .  i am also in the process of documenting the gas model for you .  i ' ve tried to do my best for you , vasant , but i have been frustrated by not  only the death of my mother but some internal systems in it here . just the  other day , sas could not open a full query of the eol database because there  wasn ' t enough free space on the server ' s hard drive for the workfiles . in  discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power  trading , people whom i have known for over 10 years , they indicated they were  ubiquitous here . the power traders have similar pc ' s to my new one , and they  have complained from day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones . also ,  there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses ;  during my brief tenure here it has gone through two differing proposals as to  how to address this . when i have been told of tools available for real - time  data harvesting , my requests for such have typically been met with "" well , we  have it , but we haven ' t really tested it yet . "" an example is the weather : we  still do not record to disk the hourly nws observations from the goes  satellite .  my interests here are to help enron to do well , because i will do well only  if enron does well . these aren ' t empty words - my ira is 100 % invested in the  enron stock fund . i believe my best contributions to enron will be in the  areas of systems as well as modeling , and the difficulty working in the  research group , in terms of systems development , is that , frankly , few people  at enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems . we aren ' t  directly generating revenues for enron , and we aren ' t really their customers ,  except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses .  as it happens , power trading posted an opening for a modeling and forecasting  person , and i spoke with them and they asked me to take the job , reporting to  george hopley . it is a wonderful opportunity for me , vasant , as they are  interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their  traders ' access to real - time fundamentals data . i was completely candid with  kevin presto regarding my shortcomings here in research - i told him you were  disgusted with me because i repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines . they  also understand i have yet to be at enron for 1 year , and thus may only bid  on a job with your permission . we agree the move is good for enron ; we all  work for enron , and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but  merely permit it . they are comfortable with me - they have known me for years  as a hard worker , honest and unpretensive . they have already ordered a  state - of - the - art unix workstation and server for me , and they have told me  they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful ,  including hiring an analyst to work for me . and , i have already been able to  teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis i  have learned here .  so , i am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening . it would be  a lateral move in position and salary , and i would commit to you to help you  in any way possible in the future with regards the gas model or the eol  database . i will continue to work on their improvement , and complete their  documentation .  as it happens , i am away on enron business in portland monday and tuesday ,  and will be back wednesday . i had wanted to talk face - to - face instead of by  email , but enron business supercedes - i am on a team designing the data  warehouse for floor trader support .  clayton .",0

"Subject: fw : london work  hi ,  how are you ? london seems to be the same as when i left in august - no sun ,  cold , serious looking people , expensive , etc . in addition , we have had may  day riots , a post office bombing , train strike , etc . not to mention all the  excitement in enron credit .  it would be nice to know who i am supposed to be reporting to . i am getting  loads of conflicting messages - as illustrated in the forwarded email from  vasant . according to you and slava , the strategy paper / duffie report seems  to be a higher priority . however , vasant seems to indicate ( in his forwarded  email ) that this is not the priority at the moment .  in addition , there seems to be lots of chaos in enron credit - not only in  the houston office , but even more so in the london office . this brings to  mind a russian proverb i learned from slava when he expressed his views on  the current state of enron credit - "" a fish rots from the head . ""  finally , i would like to know exactly what you want me to write in this  duffie report : do you want to hear what enron credit would like to hear -  that all they need is for us to develop a private firm model for their  exisiting "" infrastructure "" ? or do you want to hear what i really see , hear ,  read , etc . ? if the latter is true , then i may need to write two reports ,  because what i am learning does not look too good and would probably not make  the enron credit personnel too happy .  well , i think i have said enough for now . look forward to your feedback .  thanks ,  iris  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : shanbhogue , vasant  sent : friday , may 04 , 2001 3 : 39 pm  to : mack , iris  cc : dhar , amitava  subject : london work  hi iris ,  amitava must have told you that both he and i are getting swamped with work  here . as a result , we expect you to take the lead in scoping the enron  credit project and making sure the infrastructure is readied . you should  also make sure to understand the econometric / data analysis software side of  the project - - this is probably more important than preparing a document for  duffie right now . you should definitely sit with ben / george and actually run  the software with them to get a feel for how it is to be used . but we also  need to be able to try out potential other ways of analyzing data . both  amitava and i will help as best as we can , and answer any direct questions ,  but we will have limited time to review documents , etc . i expect amitava to  get heavily involved once data starts coming , but we expect you to have  already set up the infrastructure etc for the data .  hope the trip is going well . would you be extending the trip for some more  time ?  vasant",0

"Subject: wall street ' s dirty little secret . . .  it was the spring of 1979 .  i was just a tall , goofy looking kid in middle school  with buck - teeth and freckles . each day in the  cafeteria , i walked from table to table . . .  stealing other kids ' lunch money .  no , i didn ' t rob them with a gun or a knife - i just made  them a little deal . "" let me borrow two dollars today , "" i said ,  "" and i ' ll bring you five dollars next week . "" the investment  was too good to pass up , and other kids were throwing their  lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes . of course  when "" next week "" rolled around and i couldn ' t pony up the cash ,  i promised to pay them even more the week after that ,  if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit  longer .  eventually the end of the year came and went , high school  started and with it came girls , and homework , and parties ,  and sports , and those poor kids from eighth grade had more  things on their mind than last year ' s lunch money .  i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid ,  and i didn ' t even get beat up .  hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market  secrets you will ever learn .  first of all , greed is your number one enemy . you ' re not  going to turn $ 2 into $ 5 in a week , so cash out when  you ' re ahead . don ' t wait for the boat to sink before  grabbing the lifejacket .  second , never trust an investment adviser of any kind .  they are looking out for their own money , not yours .  the "" professionals "" , those stuffy investment counselors and  money managers , will always tell you that the best time to  buy is now . according to those guys , the longer you keep  your money in the market , the more money you ' re going to make .  ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is  "" never "" .  in a sense , they are right . if you put $ 250 , 000 in an index  fund right now , you ' ll probably have over a million dollars  in thirty or forty years . but here ' s the problem :  do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich ?  hell no !  you want the money now - so you can enjoy it . it ' s hard to  make use of your fortune when you ' re seventy years old  in a wheelchair . if you could make a million dollars in  the next few years , what would you do with it ? where would  you travel ? what kind of car would you buy ?  the fact is . . . youth is the best time to be rich .  if your goal is to make quick profits in the market , volatility  is your ally , and stability your enemy . you want to see  those large upswings , two hundred points in a day , followed  by the four hundred point crash a week later . you don ' t  care if the market went up or down 20 % this year as long  it was unstable . that ' s how you ' re going to make the  money .  what i ' m talking about here is day trading .  my father invests the traditional way ; he holds some good stocks  and he goes up 30 k and down 30 k . in the long term of 5 - 10 years  he makes money .  the day trader buys or sells 5 , 000 shares of xyz for a  $ 25 , 000 profit in a 5 - 10 minute trade . he acts quickly , taking  advantage of all the information at his disposal about a  certain stock , and estimating whether it will go up or  down within hours , sometimes within minutes .  i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing  amounts of money at it . it ' s not rocket science , and you  only need to learn a few basic principles to get started .  society would have you believe that successful trading is  complicated and requires formal training .  the truth is , wealthy people use very simple investment  strategies to make money .  popular media and investment professionals portray successful  trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing  ring . they don ' t want the competetion - and they sure as hell  don ' t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm  to execute a trade for which they ' d charge you forty or fifty  dollars .  they make their money only if you believe two lies :  1 ) that investing is too difficult and risky for the average  person .  2 ) that using an investment adviser who charges a high  commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks  per trade .  here is what the financial gurus in today ' s society absolutely ,  positively do not want you to know . . .  the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact  so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend  a few hours of studying .  after reading over 200 financial books and publications  during the past decade , and after using day trading  to successfully make more than four million dollars in  the stock market , i ' ve learned the following lessons :  * * achieving financial success is incredibly simple .  * * anyone can do it .  * * it only takes a few hours to learn .  when i discovered the secret to day trading , i didn ' t become  wealthy overnight . if you want instant cash , drive to wal - mart .  buy a ski mask and a shotgun , and rob your local bank . the  only way to get rich , quick or otherwise , is through  hard work , knowledge , and determination .  after learning the fundamentals of day trading , i started  practicing the trading art itself , and the first few weeks  brought modest gains . the next few months gave me the practical  experience i needed to really earn a living , and i was pulling  close to a six figure income . in less than three years with no  formal financial training , minimal effort and only moderate risk ,  i had made my first million . the knowledge that i gained  during those formative trading years i am willing to share  with you in my new book , the master trader . you will learn from  my mistakes , and from my successes , as i teach you the simple ,  secret formula for day trading that i ' ve used profitably  year after year .  the income of the day trader can be staggering . thousands , even  hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within  minutes . the difference between making money and losing your  shirt is simply this : knowledge . i will provide that knowledge ,  and i will give you a winning edge at this high - stakes game .  average income of a day trader :  5 % average an income in excess of $ 500 , 000 per year  22 % average an income in excess of $ 250 , 000 per year  35 % average an income in excess of $ 100 , 000 per year .  27 % average an income between $ 50 , 000 and $ 99 , 999 per year  11 % average an income between $ 20 , 000 and $ 49 , 999 per year  after reading the master trader , you will discover extremely  profitable , simple yet powerful trading methods that give  you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you  win despite the current market weakness .  here is just a snippet of what i will teach you :  * * * make money whether a stock goes up or down .  * * * learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds .  * * * learn exactly what stocks to trade , the exact price to  buy them and the exact price to sell them .  * * * save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the  mistakes beginners make .  * * * learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money  consistently in every market !  * * * learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance  for great success .  * * * profit on huge intraday price swings .  * * * make money on the biggest news stories .  * * * actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum  returns .  * * * learn how to use the tools and information wall street  professionals use .  * * * learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind .  it ' s time to ask yourself : "" am i going to listen to the  professionals who say buy buy buy but never sell ? or am  i going to take control of my own financial future , and  start making money right now in the stock market ? ""  who is looking out for your best economic interests - some  wealthy wall street stockbroker , or yourself ?  with the master trader e - book , you will learn everything you  need to know in order to get started with day trading . . . from  choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the  lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional  trading strategies that make professional traders millions of  dollars .  the master trader e - book is the most comprehensive yet easy to  understand and straight - forward book ever written about active  trading . if you are serious about success in short term stock  trading - order today and start paving the road to your  own financial future .  oh , and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade ?  his high school friends laughed when he said he was going to  make money in the stock market .  six years later , he bought a beach - front home on the california  coast - with cash . oops , they weren ' t laughing anymore .  in a rollercoaster market like we have today , day trading  is the fastest track to wealth . if you ' re looking  for a long - term retirement investment with no risk  that goes up 5 % a year , then by all means , this ain ' t  your kind of game .  but if you want the quickest possible way to make a fortune  in the market , with the lowest element of risk , then  order the master trader e - book right now . i promise  to teach you all of the secrets that helped me become a  millionaire through successful day trading .  you don ' t need to know anything about the market , and  anyone can do it , with minimum effort . it ' s an easy  game to win if you know how the pieces move .  order the master trader e - book right now for only $ 49 . 97  by clicking on the link below :  http : / / 4 tools 4 life . com / qs  our company is strictly opposed to unsolicited emails .  to be removed from this list , please send an email  to "" bulkexpert @ yahoo . com "" ",1

"Subject: california update 3 / 06 / 01  executive summary  ? if no comprehensive deal is reached by april 9 th , chances of bankruptcy  increase due to a one day "" opt - out "" clause in all long - term power contracts .  ? pg & e and state locked in tough negotiations , several issues on the table :  puc - imposed requirement forcing pg state - 2 . 3 times book value vs . pg & e - 4 times book value  ? pg & e will not use any of the $ 1 b secured last week to help their ailing  utility .  ? davis ' s announcement of long term power contract didn ' t include some  details :  of the 8 , 800 megawatts secured this far , only 6 , 000 are available this  summer  some of the "" long term contracts "" are really only for three months  none of the contracts prevent california from buying peak demand on the spot  market  ? one the same day davis announced long term contracts , davis also quietly  announce a 10 % rate hike .  ? ferc may be the wild card in approving this deal .  pg & e  transmissions deal  one thing that is still uncertain is pg & e . bankruptcy may still be a likely  alternative if current negotiations to buy pg & e ' s share of the electric  transmission grid fail to produce a deal by april 9 ( when all long - term power  contracts being negotiated have a one - day "" opt - out "" clause they can exercise  unilaterally if a "" comprehensive solution "" has not been reached by the state  and its major utilities ) . according to sources close to senior pg & e  officials , pg & e made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal  on the transmission lines depends on the california government ' s willingness  to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make  until now .  pg & e will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless davis agrees to  relieve it of the puc - imposed requirement to be the "" electricity buyer of  last resort . "" current state regulations make the utility companies  ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all  times to supply california ' s energy needs . as long as the state steps in and  makes those purchases , as it has for the past three months , the utilities are  shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot  market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings .  but , pg & e officials are worried 1 ) this summer ' s supply and 2 ) davis ' s  concern over how fast he is draining the state ' s budget surplus . if things  get into a crunch this summer and davis makes a new decision that the state  will pay only for the electricity it buys through long - term contracts , then  pg & e will be left holding the bag .  thus , as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid , pg & e is  demanding a "" comprehensive solution "" that includes not being liable for cost  differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed  to pay . state officials are in no mood to grant that kind of "" get out of  jail free "" card , so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough  negotiations that are complicated by three other factors : ( 1 ) pg ( 2 ) state legislative  demands that the price davis negotiate for pg and ( 3 ) the ferc must  "" positively approve "" any grid purchase by the state of california .  the principal concern on the price front is that pg & e wants to sell the  electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their  transmission , while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the  politically acceptable limit . "" we see 2 . 3 times book value as an absolute  upper bound . there is no way pg & e will get more than that , whatever they  think , "" according to the leader of one main consumer groups . "" we are going  to try to force any deals down to about 2 . 0 in any case . "" negotiators for  davis are also trying to ' proposition - proof ' any transmission deal to protect  against a later ballot proposal . they think there are ways to do that , but  not if the price of pg & e ' s part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative .  remember , if davis ' s eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative , he will  be running for re - election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed  to overturn his solution .  on the sacramento front - no one understands pg & e ' s motives  the one question no one in sacramento can figure out is what kind of game  pg & e is playing . in a three day period pg & e made a series of announcements  that left everyone scratching their heads .  ? late thursday , pg & e officials leaked information to california papers that  they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity  transmission grid to the state , which seemed like obvious good news , but then  made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least 30 %  above what the state was currently offering . while a deal can still be done ,  anything like the $ 10 billion pg & e wants would be very hard to get through  the california legislature which needs to approve any purchase .  ? late friday , pg & e officials announced that they had secured a $ 1 billion  loan for the parent company ( not the electricity utility ) and would use the  money to pay off bondholders , other creditors and to return $ 161 million to  shareholders in a new dividend payout . not a cent of that money was  earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of pg & e and that left at  least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the  utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood .  ? over the weekend , pg & e leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay  off its energy suppliers ' debt for 15 cents on the dollar right now . for  generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to  start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy  action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will  "" make them whole "" in a couple of months , that kind of trial balloon is  extremely unnerving .  thus , in a very short time period , pg & e ' s corporate owners showed they could  access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they  were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the  energy crisis . davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at  least a part of the $ 13 billion debt they have accumulated since last summer  and pg & e ' s fund - raising will harden and deepen those demands . as one senior  political official told our source "" just when you think the corporate  leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible , they  come up with something even more outrageous . ""  pg and some of these "" long - term contracts "" are actually only good  for three months . none of these contracts , however , keep california from  having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market .  davis agrees on new consumer electricity rate hikes for next year  while the media was concern with davis ' s announcement of long term contracts  for california , of less concern to the media was davis ' s quietly announced a  decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers . the state will  accept the 10 % emergency surcharge levied on consumers in january as a  permanent increase as well as an additional 10 % increase for consumers that  will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires .  that would bring the average charge to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour .  ferc  the other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the federal  energy regulatory commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve  it in a positive vote . senior california officials and legislators doubt that  ferc has jurisdiction , and believe that ferc would not dare stop a deal . but  they may be wrong . "" the deal can only go through if ferc specifically signs  off on the deal . its power over transmission deal is absolute , no matter what  anyone says , "" according to source close to the president . there are three  possibilities : 1 ) ferc could "" pocket veto "" it by not even putting it on  agenda for discussion ; 2 ) the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted  down . the democrat on the commission , william massey , has already said he is  opposed to it ; or 3 ) the commission could approve it but with condition that  davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system .  one complicating factor in the ferc decision , however , is that its chairman  curt hebert , who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale , may not  be around long enough to have his say . "" hebert is definitely not a shoo in  for the ferc chairman position , "" says one washington official . two other  appointments to the commission will soon be named , this official notes , and  one of them "" could easily become chairman .

"Subject: alliance info alert  dear generation / power marketing executive :  this alliance info alert includes three items of interest :  1 ) the weekly alliance express newsletter  2 ) listing of recent filings at ferc  3 ) timeline for ferc action on california markets ( attached )  alliance of energy suppliers express   december 19 , 2000  inside washington   federal affairs  * * * ferc de - federalizes california markets , adopts other structural reforms * * *  at a special meeting friday afternoon , ferc unanimously approved its eagerly  awaited final order reforming the california wholesale markets , adopting the  major outlines of its november 1 proposed order and sending back to  california the responsibility for addressing state - related matters . at the  same time , ferc deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as well  as the imposition of region - wide price caps . ferc reiterated their earlier  conclusions that under certain circumstances , california ratepayers were  subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to california ' s  "" seriously flawed "" market structure and rules in conjunction with tight  demand and supply conditions throughout the west .  ferc adopted the november proposal to eliminate , effective immediately , the  state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s investor - owned utilities buy  and sell electricity through the px , and allow these utilities to purchase  electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to  manage supply risks . ferc terminated the px ' s rate schedules effective at  the close of business on april 30 , 2001 . in effect , as chairman james  hoecker stated , the order de - federalizes 60 percent of the california  wholesale market established under the state ' s restructuring law , returning  ratemaking authority over company - owned generation to the california public  utilities commission ( cpuc ) .  the agency also modified the effective period of the $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap ""  proposal , limiting its application through april 2001 , whereupon a  "" comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which  incorporates appropriate thresholds , screen and mitigation measures "" must be  in place . in a related move , ferc ordered a technical conference early next  year to develop such a program by march 1 , 2001 , so that these measures can  be place by the may 1 , deadline .  * * * energy secretary issues order to power generators and marketers to bolster  california ' s supplies * * *  energy secretary bill richardson has responded to the severely constrained  power supply situation in california by issuing an order , pursuant to section  202 ( c ) of the federal power act , to require generators and marketers to make  power available to meet the state ' s electricity needs . the emergency  directive requires that , if the california independent system operator ( iso )  certifies that there is an inadequate supply of electricity , certain  suppliers would be required to make power available to the iso if they have  power available in excess of the amount needed to satisfy service to firm  customers . those suppliers that have provided power to the california power  exchange ( px ) and the iso over the last 30 days that have firm capacity  available would be subject to the order .  under the order , the iso is required to provide notice to each supplier  subject to the order of the amount and type of service requested by 9 : 00 pm  est on the day before the requested service . the iso must , to the extent  feasible , allocate the requests in proportion to the amount of each  supplier ' s available power . the price for the power provided pursuant to the  order will be set by an agreement between the iso and the supplier . if no  agreement is reached , ferc is to determine the just and reasonable rate at a  later date . the order will remain in effect until 3 : 00 am est on december  21 , 2000 unless modified .  * * * epa sets plans to regulate plants ' mercury emissions * * *  epa administrator carol browner , in a long - awaited announcement , indicated  last week that the administration will require reductions of mercury  emissions from coal - and oil - fired power plants . the agency stated that it  plans to propose new regulations in december 2003 , and hopes to finalize new  rules by december 2004 .  in the wake of the decision , eei called on epa to make certain that any  program to control utilities ' mercury emissions be based on the best  scientific information available in order to assure the protection of public  health . "" eei urges epa to maintain its commitment to resolving the key  scientific and technological issues , "" said paul bailey , eei vice president ,  environmental affairs . given these uncertainties , eei is disappointed that  the regulatory determination includes statements regarding public health  threats and hazards that are unsupported by current science , "" said mr . bailey .  "" in the meantime , the electric power industry will continue to work with all  stakeholders to determine the extent to which additional mercury reductions  from power plants may be needed , and how those cuts should be achieved , "" mr .  bailey concluded .  mergers & acquisitions  * * * calpine completes acquisition of emi power assets * * *  calpine corporation has announced that it has completed the acquisition of  power assets from energy management , inc . ( emi ) . in the deal , calpine  acquired the remaining interest in three recently constructed , combined - cycle  power generating facilities located in new england , as well as a joint  marketing venture between calpine and emi . prior to the transaction , calpine  held a 50 percent net interest in the projects .  "" we are very pleased to have completed the acquisition of these new and  highly efficient power plants . the dighton , tiverton , and rumford facilities  were among the first merchant power plants to enter commercial operation in  new england , "" said calpine senior vice president bob alff . "" combined with  our other announced project in the northeast , we have created a coordinated  system of low - cost assets , with excellent geographic diversity , to provide  power to a very attractive new england market , "" added alff .  * * * exelon completes acquisition of 49 . 9 percent of sithe * * *  exelon corporation and sithe energies have announced the completion of  exelon ' s acquisition of 49 . 9 percent of the stock of sithe . the completion  of the acquisition finalizes an agreement in which peco energy company agreed  to purchase 49 . 9 percent of sithe ' s assets in north america for $ 682  million . peco has since merged with unicom corporation to form exelon  corporation .  under the terms of the agreement , exelon has the option to purchase the  remaining 50 . 1 percent of sithe within two to five years at a price based on  prevailing market conditions when the purchase option is exercised . exelon  and sithe will continue to operate independently , said the companies .  energy data  * * * weekly electric output ( week 50 ) * * *  electric output reached 74 , 737 gwh for the week ending december 9 ( week 50 ) ,  with the highest increase over 1999 levels in the mid - atlantic region , which  had a 15 . 8 percent increase over 1999 . looking at year - to - date information ,  the pacific southeast leads the nation in growth of output . for more  information , email alliance @ eei . org .  who ' s who  * * * allegheny energy announces leadership change * * *  allegheny energy , inc . this week announced the appointment of michael  morrell , senior vice president and cfo , as president of its unregulated  supply business , allegheny energy supply company , effective february 1 ,  2001 . morrell will replace peter skrgic , current president , who will be  retiring on that date after 37 years of service to the company .  in his new position , mr . morrell will direct and continue the growth of  allegheny ' s energy supply business , which operates and markets competitive  retail and wholesale electric generation throughout the eastern us .  additionally , morrell will identify new opportunities to expand the company ' s  generation holdings , announced a press release .  the alliance express is a free news service sponsored by the alliance of  energy suppliers . this document can be redistributed . please send  questions , comments , or requests to alliance @ eei . org , or telephone  202 / 508 - 5680 .  * * * due to the holidays , the alliance express will not be published next  tuesday , december 26 .  = = recent ferc filings = =  ( 1 ) rto developments  * the following entities filed comments regarding the california wholesale  electric market . elo 0 - 95 - 000 , et . al . filed december 13 , 2000 .  - american public power assoc . : "" market power : will we know it when we see  it ? the california experience ""  - southern california edison co . : "" proof that soft price caps do not result  in lawful rates "" and request for rehearing  - southern california edison co . : request for immediate modification of the  december 8 , 2000 order  - san diego gas & electric : motion to clarify the record  * the following entities filed motions for an immediate modification and to  intervene regarding the commission ' s emergency order december 8 approving the  ca iso ' s tariff amendments . erol - 607 - 000 , ero 0 - 95 - 000 et . al . filed  december 13 , 2000 .  - western power trading forum  - reliant energy power generation  - pacific gas and electric  - ca iso  - dynegy power marketing  * southern energy companies filed a supplemental protest regarding pjm ' s  order 2000 compliance filing . rtol - 2 - 000 . filed december 14 , 2000 .

"" you must never try to send any command to that address , as it  would be distributed to all the people who have subscribed . all commands  must be sent to the "" listserv address , "" listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . it  is very important to understand the difference between the two , but  fortunately it is not complicated . the listserv address is like a fax  number that connects you to a machine , whereas the list address is like a  normal voice line connecting you to a person . if you make a mistake and  dial the fax number when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone , you  will quickly realize that you used the wrong number and call again . no  harm will have been done . if on the other hand you accidentally make your  fax call someone ' s voice line , the person receiving the call will be  inconvenienced , especially if your fax then re - dials every 5 minutes . the  fact that most people will eventually connect the fax machine to the  voice line to allow the fax to go through and make the calls stop does  not mean that you should continue to send faxes to the voice number .  people would just get mad at you . it works pretty much the same way with  mailing lists , with the difference that you are calling hundreds or  thousands of people at the same time , and consequently you can expect a  lot of people to get upset if you consistently send commands to the list  address .  you may leave the list at any time by sending a "" signoff frbnyrmagl ""  command to listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . you can also tell listserv how  you want it to confirm the receipt of messages you send to the list . if  you do not trust the system , send a "" set frbnyrmagl repro "" command and  listserv will send you a copy of your own messages , so that you can see  that the message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way .  after a while you may find that this is getting annoying , especially if  your mail program does not tell you that the message is from you when it  informs you that new mail has arrived from frbnyrmagl . if you send a "" set  frbnyrmagl ack norepro "" command , listserv will mail you a short  acknowledgement instead , which will look different in your mailbox  directory . with most mail programs you will know immediately that this is  an acknowledgement you can read later . finally , you can turn off  acknowledgements completely with "" set frbnyrmagl noack norepro "" .  contributions sent to this list are automatically archived . you can get a  list of the available archive files by sending an "" index frbnyrmagl ""  command to listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . you can then order these files  with a "" get frbnyrmagl logxxxx "" command , or using listserv ' s database  search facilities . send an "" info database "" command for more information  on the latter .  important : this list is confidential . you should not publicly mention its  existence , or forward copies of information you have obtained from it to  third parties . please note that the "" give "" command is automatically  disabled for all archive files .  more information on listserv commands can be found in the listserv  reference card , which you can retrieve by sending an "" info refcard ""  command to listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com .",0
"Subject: re : default rates  mark , this is a good point . in moody ' s june 1999 study , debt recoveries for  corporate bankruptcies , there is a graph of firm - level recovery rates by year  of bankruptcy resolution ( as opposed to default year ) . reading from the  graph finds :  as the data above is based on resolution year , the same study finds the  average length of time spent in bankruptcy is 1 . 30 years ( median 1 . 15 years  and standard deviation of 1 . 20 years ) . the interesting point is the slide in  recovery value 1996 to 1998 . one would wonder if the mix of high - yield  issuance slanted towards the tech companies would yield lower recoveries  ( quick technological obsolescence - - little tangible recovery value ) .  interesting to note is the december 1999 to december 2000 change in spreads .  the table below divides the december 2000 spreads by the december 1999  spreads . one would have expected a pronounced flight to safety over this  time - frame , but the figures are more mixed :  to : michael tribolet / corp / enron @ enron , william s bradford / hou / ect @ ect , david  gorte / hou / ect @ ect , vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : re : default rates  per our discussion , see attached for impact of assumed recovery rates :  michael tribolet @ enron  12 / 11 / 2000 08 : 09 am  to : william s bradford / hou / ect @ ect , david gorte / hou / ect @ ect , vince j  kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , mark ruane / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : default rates  please see below for my note to jeremy at the bottom and his reponse . i  have placed mark ruane ' s yields against a mid november default frequency  table . note there may be a slight shearing in dates , but the concept is  more important :  market implied cumulative default rates ( % ) :  1 year 5 year 10 year  aaa 0 . 51 5 . 74 14 . 54  aa 0 . 67 6 . 39 16 . 61  a 0 . 98 8 . 98 21 . 03  bbb 1 . 17 9 . 88 22 . 39  bb 3 . 27 18 . 62 37 . 51  b 4 . 65 24 . 21 46 . 27  s & p historical default rates ( % ) :  1 year 5 year 10 year  aaa 0 . 00 0 . 13 0 . 67  aa 0 . 01 0 . 33 0 . 90  a 0 . 04 0 . 47 1 . 48  bbb 0 . 21 1 . 81 3 . 63  bb 0 . 91 8 . 82 14 . 42  b 5 . 16 20 . 95 27 . 13  in looking at the one - year transition rates as a very rough proxy for how  many more defaults occur in a recession ( 1991 ) versus average ( 1981 - 1999 )  historical default rates ( % ) :  investment grade non - investment  grade  avg . 1981 - 99 0 . 07 4 . 21  1991  0 . 12 10 . 40  multiple 1 . 7 x  2 . 5 x  looking at where the market implied default rates divided by the historicals  default rates to obtain a "" multiple "" ( how much more severe than historical ) :  1 year 5 year 10 year  aaa infinite 44 . 2 x 21 . 7 x  aa 67 . 0 x 19 . 4 x 18 . 5 x  a 24 . 5 x 19 . 1 x 14 . 2 x  bbb 5 . 6 x 5 . 5 x 6 . 2 x  bb 3 . 6 x 2 . 1 x 2 . 6 x  b 1 . 1 x 1 . 2 x 1 . 7 x  on the 10 year historical figures , we need to be careful as the s & p static  pool figures show a definite seasoning ( lower defaults in late years probably  due to prepayment ) versus our contracts . secondly , the s & p figures have  withdrawn ratings , which usually mean they are stale , but loosing some  information content .  i will ask emy to set up a meeting to discuss further .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by michael tribolet / corp / enron on 12 / 11 / 2000  07 : 06 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  from : jeremy blachman @ ees on 12 / 10 / 2000 07 : 21 am  to : michael tribolet / corp / enron @ enron  cc :  subject : default rates  thanks . i would strongly suggest an offsite sooner than later with a handful  of the right people so that we can step back and design the right  architecture for looking at credit in our deals . it is broken , not clear ,  killing our velocity and true capabilities . we also need to look at staffing ,  skills sets , the credit reserve model etc . perhaps you should take a crack at  an agenda .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by jeremy blachman / hou / ees on 12 / 10 / 2000  07 : 08 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  michael tribolet @ enron  12 / 09 / 2000 03 : 51 pm  to : jeremy blachman / hou / ees @ ees  cc :  subject : default rates  i visited with vince kaminski for about 20 minutes today regarding the market  implied defaults rates and the disconnect in investment grade land . he is  seeing the same anomaly and agreed that we as a company need to revisit the  methodology employed in calculating the implied figures . i will follow  through and report back .",0

"Subject: re : pricing credit on thousands of names  we can continue the discussion in tuesday ' s conference call , but i discussed  with ben about the issues below , and here are some thoughts . this is not a  complete approach , but only a starting point for discussion .  the main task is to build a pricing system for many names .  this has two components - - -  1 ) how to price a single name ?  1 . 1 ) how to price a liquid single name ?  1 . 2 ) how to price an illiquid single name ?  2 ) how to efficiently apply the methodology to multiple names ?  the approach i would take for 1 . 1 is  a ) define a small set of liquid names  b ) apply each of the different models we have , say , the six models ben has  mentioned below , to these names  c ) include market prices , if any , for these names  d ) sit with traders , get trader ' s intuition on where each liquid name should  price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in ( b ) and ( c )  e ) try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion  of the trader prices across the models  f ) quantify these attributes , if possible  g ) try a different set of liquid names and repeat the process , and see if the  decisions in the last round still make sense  the approach for 1 . 2 may be  a ) define a small set of illiquid names  b ) apply each of the different models we have to these names  c ) sit with traders , get trader ' s intuition on where each illiquid name  should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in ( b )  d ) try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion  of the trader prices across the models  e ) check if these are similar to the attributes identified for liquid names  f ) define a master set of liquid names  g ) look for relationships ( by analyzing cross - section of data ) between  attributes or prices of illiquid names to those of liquid names  once a mapping has been defined for an illiquid name to a set of liquid names  and their attributes , then this mapping can be entered into a table , and the  pricing can be automated for all names ( in theory ) ! the success will depend  on the success of the round - table sessions for the approaches for 1 . 1 and  1 . 2 .  building a new fundamental model is always a worthwhile task , but we can get  going with the above approaches immediately in parallel with developing any  new models that we may build . new models can be added to the suite of  existing models . i do not believe there will ever be a single model that will  answer all questions for all names , but rather we can refine the mappings and  relative choices among models over time , which would mean continuing  round - table sessions with traders . limited data makes calibration very hard ,  so i would continually ask the question "" what do we calibrate ? "" throughout  the discussions for 1 . 1 and 1 . 2 , and this may help guide us to new models .  vasant  benjamin parsons  06 / 19 / 2000 04 : 11 am  to : ect london credit trading  cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , amitava  dhar / corp / enron @ enron , steven leppard / lon / ect @ ect , grant masson / hou / ect @ ect ,  dale surbey / lon / ect @ ect , david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect , jitendra j  patel / lon / ect @ ect , oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect  subject : pricing credit on thousands of names  all -  our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to  provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [ 5 , 000 by year - end ] .  most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information ,  making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of  competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we  plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective .  currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under  development :  fmc model ( default probability approach ) . using bloomberg ' s fair market ( par  yield ) curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then  default / bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology .  fmc model ( credit spread approach ) . using the fmcs , then directly taking the  libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding  differences .  bond model ( fmc approach ) . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model  regresses the input bonds ( specific to a name ) on the two best fitting  benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs ,  but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated  using both spread and probability approaches . under testing .  bond model ( spline approach ) . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer ,  the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve ,  then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing .  market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors / ratings , cds market  prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap  prices .  kmv . using expected default frequencies ( edfs ) from the kmv model and  database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate  risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next .  each of these models returns a price ( credit default and bankruptcy ) , and the  accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory  differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia ,  capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid  names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside  other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing  system .  our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and  market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific ' soft ' data from  credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a  price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the  credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial  information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights .  the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with  market ( or trader ) prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the  weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the  system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid  market prices ( bonds , equities , default swaps ) , where the weightings are  calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc .  the key steps to implementing such a system will be :  establishing what exactly we want to ' predict ' - is it a price , a rating , a  probability , or a score ? we will need a clean market history to calibrate to ,  which we only really have for ratings . we will then need to develop a mapping  from rating / score to price .  getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to  calibrate the model .  building the mechanics of the model , ie , the calibration methodology . neural  nets / fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates , but which exact methods and  software packages to use ?  determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited  information into the model .  getting the "" true "" market price , in order to feed back an error . at present  such a price exists for very few credits .  allocating resources to the development . mckinsey claimed such a system would  take 6 - 10 man - months to develop .  further ideas or comments are requested , as we need to develop our strategy  asap . the model description above is fairly vague , as we don ' t yet have the  knowledge needed to fill in the specific details . further help will be  especially required on this if we are to continue to move at ' internet speed ' .  regards  ben",0

( although it will probably be clear from our discussions the  model ( s ) we ? prefer ) . we therefore try and give ? as clear account as possible  of the advantage and disadvantages of all the ? models so that the reader can  make an informed choice as to the models which ? best suit their needs .  in order to meet our objectives the ? book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to ?  model and  price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the ? book . in  addition to introducing ? the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline ? the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and  monte carlo simulation for ? derivative pricing , which are used throughout the  book .  in chapter 2 we discuss the ? analysis of spot energy prices . as ? well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes ? that  can  be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of geometric  brownian motion as well as ? mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump  processes , discussing each and ? showing how they can be simulated and their  parameters estimated .  chapter 3 , written by vince ? kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron  corp . , discusses volatility ? estimation in energy commodity markets . ? this  chapter builds on the previous one . it examines in detail the methods , ?  merits  and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different ? pricing  models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and electricity  markets are used to illustrate ? the technical and interpretative aspects of  calculating volatility .  chapter 4 examines forward curves ? in the energy markets . although ? such  curves  are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial ? markets , the  difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well ? defined  curves .  in this chapter we ? describe forward price bounds for energy prices and the  building of forward ? curves from market instruments . we ? outline the three  main  approaches which have been applied to building forward ? curves in energy  markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric approach , and ? deriving  analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic factors .  chapter 5 presents an overview of ? structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy  swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options ,  and ladder options .  chapter 6 investigates single and ? multi - factor models of the energy spot  price  and the pricing of some standard ? energy derivatives . closed form ? solutions  for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices ? both on  the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in ? this  chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience yield and interest  rate model .  chapter 7 shows how the prices of ? path dependent and american style options  can  be evaluated for the models in ? chapter 6 . simulation schemes are ? developed  for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety ? of  path  dependent options . in order ? to price options which incorporate early  exercise  opportunities , a trinomial ? tree scheme is developed . this tree ? is built to  be  consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to ? price exotic  as  well as standard european and american style options .  chapter 8 describes a methodology ? for valuing energy options based on  modelling  the whole of the market observed ? forward curve . the approach results ? in a  multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined volatility structures  can be of an extremely general ? form . closed - form solutions are ? developed  for  pricing standard european options , and efficient monte carlo ? schemes are  presented for pricing exotic options . the chapter closes with a discussion of  the valuation of american style options .  chapter 9 focuses on the risk ? management of energy derivative positions . ?  in  this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions ? that  trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem ?  of  managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a portfolio  containing derivatives and look ? at extensions to gamma hedging ?  illustrating  the techniques using both spot and ? forward curve models . the general ? model  presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor hedging of a ?  portfolio  of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  chapter 10 examines the key risk ? management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing ? energy derivative products . after ?  discussing  the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs ? ( volatilities ,  covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then compare the fours  major ? methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma , historical  simulation and ? monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same portfolio  of  energy ? options . in this chapter we also ? look at testing the var estimates  for  various underlying energy market ? variables .  finally , in chapter 11 we review ? modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we  look  in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan  ( 1997 ) )  and ? creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial ? products ( 1997 ) ) for which  detailed  information is publicly available . together these provide an extensive set ?  of  tools with which to measure credit risk . we present numerical examples of  applying these techniques to energy derivatives .  before ? we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book  are tools ? which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of how  both  the ? tool ? ? and the market works . the ? techniques we describe are certainly  not  ? magic wands ? which can be waved at ? data and risk management problems to  provide instant and perfect solutions . to quote from the riskmetrics  technical  document ? ? no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace experience and  professional judgement in managing risk . ? . ? however , the right tools ,  correctly  used make the job a lot ? easier !",0

"Subject: urgent reply .  from the desk of : barr arisman shonikon  chambers & associates  no 56 b . aba road , port - harcourt nigeria  private email address ( @ shymail . com )  dear  i sincerely apologize for intruding into your privacy especially by  contacting you through this means for a business transaction of this  magnitude , but due to its seriousness and urgency it therefore became  necessary for me to seek your assistance .  i am barr . arisman shonikon , the personal lawyer to late mr . frank ionescu , a  foreigner , who worked with an oil servicing company in the oil rich niger  delta area of bayelsa state . i am contacting you concerning my late client  and an investment he made . i would respectfully request that you keep the  contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the  information you come by as a result of this mail . i contacted you  independently and no one should be informed of this communication . i would  like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest  to you .  this is a genuine transaction and is 100 % risk free . all i ' m demanding from  you is your honest co - operation to enable us achieve our goal , and not a  perfidious person . on the 6 th of may , 2002 it was reported to us that my  client , his wife and their only daughter were involved in a local plane  crash at kano state , enroot abuja ( the capital city ) all occupants in the  plane lost their lives , unfortunately on this same flight were other  dignitaries like the sports minister and a host of others  meanwhile , until his death , my late client had a fixed deposit account of  usd $ 15 . million deposited in a security company ( unic security company )  here . recently , i received an ultimatum from the security company asking me  to provide my late client ' s relative so that the money would be given to  them . but unfortunately it was discovered that my late client did not  declare any identifiable family member in all the official documents he  tendered to the security company while opening the account .  therefore , this development leaves me as the only person with the full  picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit my  late client made and who is entitled to be the bona fide beneficiary / next of  kin or relative because he died intestate . therefore , if i fail to locate  any of his relatives or his next of kin ( and have this money transferred to  them ) the security company will at the expiration of the 6 weeks ultimatum  given to me confiscate the account .  according to the ultimatum issued to me by the security company , if i fail  to present to them my late client ' s relative , with a legitimate statement of  claim for the money before the given time they will confiscate the account  and the money declared ' unclaimed balance ' . this will result in the money  being taken over by the security company . this will not happen if i have my  way .  since i have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives of my late client  all these while , my proposal , therefore , is to present you as the next of  kin / relative of my client due to the fact that you are a foreigner and can  easily pass as a possible relative of my client . i know you will be  wondering how possible this could be but i assure you that this is simple .  i therefore seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my client  so that the money he deposited with the security company would be paid to  you and there after you and i will share the money 40 % for you and i will be  taking 60 % . i assure you that the deposit would be released to you within a  few days because i have all the relevant information that would facilitate  that will be required on documentation .  first , i will like you to provide immediately the following information :  your full names .  contact address .  telephone / fax numbers .  with this information i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavit  that will put you in place as the next of kin . after we have successfully  satisfied the requirements of the bank the money totaling usd 15 . million  would be paid into your account for you to take 40 % and i will be taking  60 % . all i require is your honest co - operation to enable us see this  through .  there is no risk at all because everything would be done legally and my  position as a qualified attorney will facilitate everything . secondly , i  will give you all the necessary documents that would serve as evidence  proving that you are the next of kin / relative of my late client . these  documents will legally conferm on you the status to act as the beneficiary  of the estate of my late client .  what i related to you might smack of unethical practice but i want you to  understand that this is a once in life time opportunity capable of turning  around our situation . the truth is that this money would not be taken by the  government but by some greedy security company officials and i would not  fold my arms and watch this happen hence my decision to contact you .  if you are interested in doing this transaction with me kindly send your  reply to this email address : ( arismanshonikon @ shymail . com )  thank you as i await your positive response .  barr . arisman shonikon .",1

"Subject: fund raising for mit sloan school  dear vince ,  please find the following description of the program that i would like to  raise additional funding for . i will follow up today with a phone call to  answer any questions you may have .  as always we appreciate your time and support .  thanks ,  jozef  the eastern european students at mit sloan school of management are  preparing an eastern european week to be held in march 2001 . the one - week  long program will familiarize our classmates with many of the countries  that are going through the post communist transformation . as you well know ,  eastern europe has a great deal of opportunities for many companies .  unfortunately , it also presents many obstacles that make most of the  opportunities difficult to capture .  because we believe that we can help to eliminate some of these obstacles ,  we want to bring the eastern european experience to mit sloan school of  management . familiarizing the future business leaders with the countries  is only one step toward reforming eastern europe , but we believe it is  worth our time and effort .  during the week , we plan to bring series of lectures addressing the  business environment in eastern europe . we want to emphasize especially  the success stories from eastern europe . such companies as enron ,  volkswagen , exxonmobil , gm , and ge have entered the eastern european market  and show commitment to stay in it . in at least one panel discussion with  academic experts and industry participants we hope to let everyone know  that eastern europe is a real place for business .  in addition to the educational activities , we are preparing number of  cultural events that will introduce the culture of this area .  the scope of our program depends greatly on the funds we will be able to  raise from our sponsors . in return , we plan to advertise our sponsors in  every activity we will do . we will make banners and any other appropriate  advertising as desired by the sponsor . should a sponsor be willing to send  a speaker for the panel discussion or to give a speech / lecture we would  appreciate the enrichment to our program .  the advertising will reach nearly 700 sloan students and faculty . in  addition , the advertising will reach all newly admitted students , as they  will visit our campus for the admit day ( an official program to sell our  school to the admitted students ) .",0

"Subject: charity sees the need not the cost . . .  dear friend ,  as you read this , i don ' t want you to feel sorry for me , because , i believe everyone will die someday . my name is mr . reza abdulla , a merchant in safat , in ( kuwait ) i was married with two children . my wife and two children died in a car accident six years a go . i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer . it has defiled all forms of medical treatment , and right now i have only about a few months to live , according to medical experts .  i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i never really cared for anyone ( not even myself ) but my business . though i am very rich , i was never generous , i was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing i cared for . but now i regret all this as i now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world .  i believe when god gives me a second chance to come to this world i would live my life a different way from how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends . i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so , i have decided to give alms to charity organizations , as i want this to be one of the last good deeds i do on earth . so far , i have distributed money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e , algeria and malaysia . now that my health has deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself anymore . i once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which i have there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan , they refused and kept the money to themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as they seem not to be contended with what i have left for them . the last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of ten million seven hundred thousand american dollars ( u . s . $ 10 . 700 , 000 ) that i have with a finance / security company abroad . i will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations . i have set aside only 20 % for you and for your time and also 5 % as miscellaneous expenses . reply me at your earliest convenience for more directives to my private email address : reza _ abdulla @ walla . com  god be with you .  regards ,  mr . reza abdulla",1

"Subject: petrochem desk  i had a chance to speak with christian lebroc this morning with regard to curve building for petrochemicals . as it turns out , christian left rac in april and joined the petrochem desk as a trader . previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or swags . unfortunately , the group had a rough p & l year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof . when asked about the fundamentals group , christian indicated that they ' d only been around about 3 - 4 months and are not yet well - suited to curve building . john nowlan is indeed the head of the group .  from a timing perspective , i told christian that it would probably take at least 6 - 8 weeks to develop a curve , especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers / fundamentals . as was suggested yesterday during our meeting , a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a nymex component ( e . g . , crude oil ) would provide a great beginning point - - we could then potentially strengthen / augment this relationship with other key factors ( e . g . , supply and demand terms ) borne out of our market research .  nelson",0

"Subject: immediate reply needed  dear sir ,  i am dr james alabi , the chairman of contract  award and review committee set up by the federal  government of nigeria under the new civilian  dispensation to award new contracts and review  existing ones .  i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and  reputable person to handle a very confidential  transaction , which involves the transfer of a huge  sum of money to a foreign account .  there were series of contracts executed by a  consortium of multi - nationals in the oil industry in  favor of n . n . p . c . the original values of these  contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum  of us $ 12 , 320 , 000 . 00 ( twelve million three hundred and twenty thousand  united  state dollars ) . this amount has now been approved and  is now ready to be transferred being that the  companies  that actually executed these contracts have been  fully paid and the projects officially commissioned .  consequently , my colleagues and i are willing to  transfer the total amount to your account for  subsequent disbursement , since we as civil servants  are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau ( civil  service law ) from operating and / or opening foreign  accounts in our names . needless to say , the trust  reposed on you at this juncture is enormous , in  return , we have agreed to offer you 20 % of the  transferred sum , while 10 % shall be set aside for  incidental expenses ( internal and external ) between  both parties in the course of the transaction you will  be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts  in due course .  modalities have been worked out at the highest level  of the ministry of finance and the central bank of  nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds  within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of  the above stated terms .  our assurance is that your role is risk free . to  accord this transaction the legality it deserves and  for mutual security of the funds the whole approval  procedures will officially and legally processed  with your name or the name of any company you may  nominate as the bonefide beneficiary .  once more i want you to understand that having put  in over twenty - five years in the civil service of my  country , i am averse to having my image and career  dented . this matter should therefore be treated with  utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves .  please you should signify your intention to assist  by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this  transaction , if favorable we will take further steps  to brief you the full details of this viable  transaction .  i want to assure you that this business proposal is  100 % risk free as we have done our homework  properly .  i quite believe that you will protect our interest  by taking this deal strictly confidential , as we are  still in government service , which we intend to  retire from in full honor .  kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to  enable us include this transfer in the next batch  which would constitute the new quarter payments  for the 2002 financial year .  thank you and god bless .  dr james alabi",1

"Subject: come on ! it ' s fun and easy ! !  * * * please read this email to the end * * *  try it . just for fun . it will cost you 25 $ to earn at least thousands of dollars ! ! ! this thing  is legal because you are buying and selling something of value : marketing reports .  there is my true story .  i received by email the instructions include in this letter . it interests me because the  system was quite simple . in the list of people selling the reports ( as you will see above ) ,  there was a guy living not so far . i searched for his phone number and i called him . i just  wanted to know if this system was really working . he told me his business was going  very well and he was receiving from 50 $ to 150 $ in cash everyday ! that ' s why i went  into this thing !  thank ' s to the computer age and the internet !  be an internet millionaire like others within a year ! ! !  before you say ' ' bull ' ' , please read the following . this is the letter you have been hearing  about on the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a national  weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program  described below , to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated  whether or not the program was legal .  their findings proved once and for all that there are ' ' absolutely no laws prohibiting the  participation in the program and if people can "" follow the simple instruction "" they are  bound to make some mega bucks with only $ 25 out of pocket cost ' ' .  = = print this now for your future reference = =  if you would like to make at least $ 500 , 000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably ,  please read the following . . . then read it again and again ! ! !  follow the simple instruction below and  your financial dreams will come true , guaranteed !  instructions :  = = = = = order all 5 reports shown on the list below = = = = =  for each report , send $ 5 cash , the name & number of the report you are  ordering and your e - mail address to the person whose name appears on  that list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your  envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems .  = = = when you place your order , make sure = = =  = = = you order each of the 5 reports ! = = =  you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them .  your total cost $ 5 x 5 = $ 25 . 00 .  within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the 5 reports from these 5 different  individuals . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the  1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . also make a floppy of these reports and  keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer .  important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report ,  or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in step ' ' 1  through 6 ' ' or you will loose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the  way this works , you will also see how it does not work if you change it .  remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work ! ! ! people  have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the  money . but it does not work this way . believe us , some have tried to be greedy and then  nothing happened . so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed .  because if you do , it will not work for you . remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! !  this is a legitimate business . you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it .  treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time .  1 . . after you have ordered all 5 reports , take this advertisement and remove the name  & address of the person in report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and  is no doubt counting their fortune .  2 . . move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5 .  3 . . move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4 .  4 . . move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3 .  5 . . move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2  6 . . . . insert your name & address in the report # 1 position .  please make sure you copy every name & address accurately ! this is critical  to your success .  take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do  not make any other changes .  save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data . to assist you with  marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with  invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where  to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to  get this venture going :  method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally  let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you  and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing  receive only a 0 . 2 % ( 2 / 10 of 1 % ) response ( the response could be much better but lets  just say it is only 0 . 2 % ) . also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e - mails  instead of only 5 , 000 each ) .  continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response ,  that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e -  mail each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with  orders . that ' s = 100 people responded and ordered report # 2 .  those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 %  response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 .  those 1000 people send 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 5 million e - mail sent out . the  0 . 2 % response is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 .  those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e -  mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 .  that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half a million dollars ) .  your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . .  $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . .  grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00  numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst  possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will  still make a lot of money !  remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of  5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or  half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ?  there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands  more coming on line every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more !  method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet  advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places  to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we  strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for  every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it .  always provide same day service on all orders .  this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will  be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report .  = = = = = = = = = = = available reports = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  the reason for the "" cash "" is not because this is illegal or somehow "" wrong "" . it is simply  about time . time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc . concealing it  is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to  you .  order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5  cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is  concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper ,  write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail  address and your name and postal address .  place your order for these reports now :  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = report # 1 : ' the insider ' s  guide to advertising for free on the net  order report # 1 from :  y . l . wong  p . o . box no . 71819  kowloon central post office  hong kong  report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk email on the net  order report # 2 from :  martin veronneau  c . p . 70058  laval , quebec  h 7 r 5 z 2  canada  report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net  order report # 3 from :  francis kidd  p . o . box 209  homestead , pa 15120  usa  report # 4 : how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net  order report # 4 from :  m . l . frayser  p . o . box 61432  fort myers , fl 33906  usa  report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free  order report # 5 from :  stone evans  600 n . pearl , suite gl 03  dallas , tx 75201  usa  $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $  follow these guidelines to guarantee your success :  = = = if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue  sending e - mails until you do .  = = = after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100  orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails  until you do .  * * once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because  the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is  important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are  placed in front of a different report .  you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are  ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another  batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit  to the income you can generate from this business ! ! !  following is a note from the originator of this program :  you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your  life , with no risk and just a little bit of effort . you can make more money in  the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined . follow the program  exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as  it is now .  remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and  address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 . . . . . # 5 as instructed above . one of the  people you send this to may send out 100 , 000 or more e - mails and your name will be on  every one of them .  remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach .  so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to  become financially independent .  it is up to you now !

"Subject: possible rtp conference  dear mr . kaminski :  thank you for talking with me about a possible rtp conference . i would  like to include some discussions of what has been learned in other industries .  as i indicated , frank wolak suggested that i contact you . in discussing  power markets with frank and other colleagues at stanford and epri , it  seems quite evident that real - time pricing for retail customers is the  "" forgotten resource "" in more efficient power markets . there seems to be a  lot of confusion about what rtp means and it also seems that many  researchers need to address some practical but important problems . i was  asked whether a group like stanford ' s emf might explore this topic and give  it the visibility that would have it considered more seriously by  policymakers .  frank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure a  useful approach and who might also see whether enron could become a major  sponsor . i was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to enron  that the company might consider providing $ 25 , 000 . as you may appreciate ,  it requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of the  conference is widely circulated among key government groups .  i would be very interested in hearing from you if you can provide ideas and  recommendations for people ( perhaps yourself or a colleague ) to  participate . i would also appreciate any consideration by enron of  providing funding for this effort .  thank you ,  hill huntington  - retail notes . rtf  hillard g . huntington  emf - an international forum on  energy and environmental markets voice : ( 650 ) 723 - 1050  408 terman center fax : ( 650 ) 725 - 5362  stanford university email : hillh @ stanford . edu  stanford , ca 94305 - 4026  emf website : http : / / www . stanford . edu / group / emf /",0

"Subject: california update 3 / 15 / 01  executive summary  ? davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for  past utility debt  ? davis and pg & e negotiations at a standstill , sticking point is net short  for pg & e this summer  ? as the days go on with no word of a secured deal , involuntary bankruptcy  chances increase significantly among small generators and qfs  ? ferc would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions  for california  california public utility commission rate increases  today may be the turning point as the ca puc reviews the size of the  department of water resources ( dwr ) rate increase to be passed along to  consumers on their electricity bills . until now , davis has considered rate  hikes to be political suicide , but there may be some relief for him from  consumer groups . sources indicate that one of california ' s main consumer  advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption ,  but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt . dwr ,  which is currently buying power on behalf of the state , needs more income to  securitize the planned $ 10 b bond issue that is key part of davis ' plan to  sign long term power contracts . as dwr continues to spend $ 40 to $ 60 m every  day on power purchases , a well placed source informed us the dwr is  essentially bankrupt . it currently has no money for normal activities such  as ordering supplies , purchasing new equipment , etc . the department of  finance is forwarding dwr money from where ever it can ( parks , other  programs ) to purchase power , but dwr ' s hands are tied until revenue bonds are  issued . the california state treasurer phil angelides will be submitting a  recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $ 10  billion worth of state bonds .  davis & pg & e at odds  sources report that davis and pg & e negotiations are facing two difficult  challenges : 1 ) pg & e wants 2 . 9 times book , which is far more than consumer  groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines ( sce accepted 2 . 3 ) ,  and 2 ) pg & e needs relief from davis for pg & es legal responsibility to be the  ultimate power purchaser for the state , and at this point davis wants to  limit further state energy power purchases ( especially for summer ) . the  utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars  further in the red ( $ 3 to $ 4 b ) and pg a measure that if accomplished would  provide davis with even less negotiating power .  with all this activity , davis is starting to lose support in the state  legislature . sources report increasing tension between the governor and  state senate president pro - tem john burton . burton has just announced a  special senate committee will investigate the generators for evidence of  price manipulation , and the state auditor is also planning an investigation .  davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being  picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later .  qf ' s most likely source of involuntary bankruptcy  sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience  and force bankruptcy on the utilities . sb 47 x may have been california ' s  qualified facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing  against pg & e , socal ed , and sdg & e . the bill designed to cut the qf ' s costs  and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the state ' s  senate . sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further  investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates .  out with hebert , in with wood  the bush administration favors replacing hebert , jr . with texas puc head pat  wood . there is an intense battle behind the scenes between senate republican  leader trent lott , who favors hebert , and president bush , who wants wood .  the administration would prefer wood because they do not want ferc to pick a  fight with davis which means bush might ultimately lose some western states  in 2004 . in effort to tone down the recent press reports , hebert has made  several token concessions to california , including $ 69 million worth of power  refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and  power plant installation .  it ' s is expected that ferc would most likely approve any transmission deal  that davis could complete but with a list of conditions . some conditions  might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well  as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic administrative actions in  the west next year . the bush administration is opposed to price caps and  believes in free market solutions . the administration is also considering  whether it might be a good idea to privatize federally - owned assets such as  bpa .",0

"Subject: california update - urgent please read 5 / 7 / 01  sources report that the bond authorization will be put to a vote today  the bridge loan financing bill will put to a vote today in the california  assembly . the republicans are currently in caucus until 3 : 30 pst and then  will go to the floor for a vote . the current situation is very fluid , but  sources now indicate that the bill would pass with a simple majority vote ,  lacking the two - thirds needed for an immediate bond issuance . if this is the  case , the bill would not take effect for 90 days and the state would be  forced to abandon its proposed bridge loan plans . absent of last minute  financial rescues by davis or a new longer bridge loan package ( unlikely )  socal could seek voluntary bankruptcy . the main problem would then be the  waiting period for financial relief from the state through the transmission  line purchase or other assistance .  there is an outside chance that republican defectors could precipitate from  the current caucus . there is extreme pressure on the republicans from davis  and angelides . if the bill failed due to lack of republican support , it  would provide davis the opportunity to blame republicans for on - going  expenditures of $ 70 m / day ( power purchases ) , and a possible bankruptcy by  socal . the last republican who gave support to a democratic bill ( ab lx ) ,  representative bill campbell , lost his job . sources also confirm that  democrats have not met with republicans on the bond issuance since last week .",0
