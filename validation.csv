- improving the efficiency of mailings and other  promotional campaigns ( so there is an efficiency angle , see ! )  because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on  actual purchases , our results tend to be significantly more predictive than  demographic - based models . so far , the the response from utilities and "" new  entrants "" i ' ve been talking to so far has been quite positive , and we have  some tests of our data underway , but we ' re interested in talking to as many  players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet  utility needs .  i can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested , but  i guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to  arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25 th of april with whoever at enron  might have interest in hearing what we ' re up to , and ( most importantly )  listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets .  thanks very much for any help . . . i look forward to catching up and  hearing how things are going for you .  regards ,  brad davids  303 -

completed  trades for an overall profit of        at an average  percent roi  i also have several other trades that are active  one of which has already doubled in value  at which time i sold half of the options in that trade and paid for the trade  it is now a  free  trade  i also have a worksheet which tracks my overall present position in all of my trades  this one ignores the cost of the underlying stocks  for instance  in my collar trades  but is rather a measure of cashflow  my current ytd total is over   k      bob hendricks  july   i have been trading since october of   i started with     and within  year my portfolio is worth over      spread trade strategies are simple and easy to understand  i was about to give up on the stock market  but thanks to this program i have learned how to apply spread trade strategies successfully  it is great that these strategies can be used with very little money but can grow quickly without the fear of losing your entire investment    ruben p     to date has a portfolio valued over  k   keeping a close eye on netflix over the last couple of months i sold long term short puts out of the money when the stock indicated oversold conditions  as the stock bounced back and showed over bought signals i offloaded the puts and sold calls against my stock  last month netflix options alone made me over      opening up the wealthbuilder a few weeks ago i saw a recommendation for a call calendar  at the time i wanted to enter a credit trade instead of a debit trade and entered a bear call based on technical indicators  all options expired worthless and i pocketed the entire credit  this month i placed some covered calls and bull puts on taser as it rocketed up  i closed all positions after  days with a   profit  many companies proudly advertise big percentage gains  many times i  ve asked those companies if those big gains hide big losses  all with the exception of sts was hiding big losing trades  my record this year is  out of the  stocks i  ve traded have made money  it  s not the  out of  that fasi and greg get but with each month i refine my system and keep closing the gap  the education sts provides is invaluable  without it my approach would have been that of a gambler  with it my approach is systematic and disciplined and consistently profitable    gareth  july    nofearinvesting  clovis ave

? that is an aggressive set of daily mailings . i  would want to review the scope of the content and look at the frequency . ?  just like print publications , ? email newsletters are ? now the rage and too  many are ?

?  ?  * invite outside industry analysts or clients to provide commentary .  ?  * consider developing an "" editorial advisory board "" to govern the  content . ? ? traders , ? legal department , communications dept . a  multidisciplinary group that ?

"Subject: a & a math majors  vince ,  thank you so much for meeting with me friday morning about the research  group .  after leaving your office , i remembered an issue i have had with the analyst  & associate program that might be of interest to you .  during a texas a & m recruiting meeting , i learned that we have expanded our  list of majors to include computer science . i wondered why math majors were  not mentioned , and was told that there was not a business need for math  majors . like liberal arts majors , they said math majors were only considered  on a person by person basis . in my opinion , math majors have many of the  same skills as finance majors , and can easily adjust to accounting rotations  as well ( i did last summer , and finance majors in the program are forced to  every year . ) i think that enron is missing out on many qualified candidates  by limiting their recruitment effort .  at texas a & m the career center asks companies for a list of majors they are  targeting , and only allows those majors to sign up for interviews through the  career center . i sent my resume to enron and asked to be included in the  interview process on campus . however , many other math majors had not heard  of enron or the other companies , and assumed that there was no place for a  math major at a company like enron . many math majors want to continue their  education , become teachers , or work for an actuarial firm . however , many  are undecided . we are constantly told of the many business possibilities  available to math majors by our teachers and staff , but many undergraduates  are still not sure exactly what math majors can contribute in a business  environment . by not mentioning math majors to the career center ( a very  simple and inexpensive step ) , enron is losing out on a very talented pool of  people . while it would be nice to get the math majors that knew about enron  already , had thoroughly researched all companies and determined that math  majors would fit perfectly , and went the extra step to send enron their  resume outside the career center system , there are many qualified students  who do not do this , and opt for other companies who did mention math majors .  i called a manager in the a & a program to suggest that we consider at least  mentioning math majors to the career centers . i realize that it may cost  more to actively pursue them , talk to teachers , and attend math society  events . however , i told her that including them at the career center would  be very inexpensive for enron . she reiterated that they saw no business need  for math majors , and that if more upper level people began requesting them ,  it would be considered . i searched for "" mathematics "" on the enron job  website , and had a surprising number of results . i know that your group  could use math majors as well . however , this still may be too small a number  to merit a focus from the a & a recruiting department . i just wanted to bring  it to your attention in case it was something that you felt should be changed .  thanks ,  heather johnson  x 53240",0,subject a  a math majors  vince   thank you so much for meeting

including my no bs gimg members   wanting to know some of the most valuable  secrets   to my on  going internet success   let me say  above all else  i don  t believe there are any   true   secrets  to success on the net  what you do to  become successful in the online world is not a  secret    in my opinion  most successful people follow simple  clear   repeatedly  proven strategies to succeed  whether on the  net or off   but  when it comes to someone asking for advice   consultation  or simply asking   what  s your secret     i have to blush  say     persistence and personality   of course  i always follow the advice with my own little  disclaimer  what makes me successful may not work the  same for you     your first lesson is to get over  the deep  seeded idea that success  of any kind  in  my opinion  is somehow an unknown  unattainable secret   clearly  it is not  it  s not unknown  it  s not unattainable   it  s not years of digging to find the  secrets  to internet riches   one thing that  gets to me  so often in my work as an  internet consultant  author and internet success  strategist is that so many people on the net seem to  have this incredibly huge mental block that stands  between themselves and success on the net  it  s  almost as if they  ve been barraged by so many claims  of what works and what doesn  t work  and so many  long  complicated routes to actually succeeding in  their online venture  that  success  is the equivelant of a   foot high brick wall   it  s not that difficult  my friends  it is not that complicated    long  time friend and business associate rick beneteau  has a new ebook out called branding you  breaking  the bank  get it    http    www  roibot  com  bybb  cgi  im   bybtb   but  the reason i mention this is the fact that he talks  so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your  online venture a success   and  yes  rick  i come from the same school of   self marketing   marketing you  obviously  that  s  the core of his excellent new ebook  and i couldn  t  agree with him more   point being   you  are everything you do online to  succeed  you are your web site  your business  your  marketing piece  your customer service  your customers   experiences with your business   all of it  is you   read his ebook  you  ll see more of what i  m saying   the matter at hand is that brick wall you might have  standing high as you can see  blocking the path  between you  internet success  listen to me  it is  not real ok  it doesn  t exist  there  s nothing there  to fear to begin with    get over it    what i  m telling you is  the only thing standing between  you and the success you most desire    is yourself   when you realize this  you will tear down that brick  wall by means of complete and instantaneous  disintegration  it will no longer exist  in your mind    which is the only  real  place it ever was anyhow   yes   persistence and personality  inherently includes  honesty  integrity  accountability  and many other  qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate  goals and realize that probably the most valuable   powerful key to your success    is you   that may be the most incredible  secret  we ever  uncover in our lifetime  and  trust me  that brick wall  won  t ever get in your way again    unless you let it   talk about simple    bryan is a  veteran  internet

( fixed deposit ) for 36 calendar months , valued at us $ 20 , 500 , 000 . 00  ( twenty nine million five hundred thousand dollars only ) in my branch . upon  maturity in 2000 , i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address  but got no reply .  after a month , we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract  employers , the british petroleum corporation that mr . haffez al sadique  died as a result of torture in the hand of sadam hussein during one of his  trips to his country iraq . on further investigation ,  i found out that he died without making a will , and all attempts to trace  his next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made further investigation and  discovered that mr haffez al sadique . did not declare any kin or relations  in all his official documents , including his bank deposit paperwork in my  bank .  this sum of us $ 29 , 500 , 000 . 00 have been floating as unclaimed since 2000  in my bank as all efforts to get his relatives have hit the stones .  according to the british law at the expiration of 8 ( eight ) years , the money  will revert to the ownership of the british government if nobody applies  to claim the fund and the eight years is the end of december 2004 .  consequently , my proposal is that i want to seek your consent as a foreigner  to stand in as the owner of the money as the next of kin to the deceased  so that the bank will transfer the money to your designated account . all  documents and proves to enable you get this fund will be carefully worked  out . i have secured from the probate an order of mandamus

exactly what they will buy . companies can show  different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of  flexibility  was not available until the internet came about .  the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the  methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of  other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are  many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a  given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer  to which customers and how much to charge for these services .  research strategy :  our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components  which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these  components are choice models and optimization models .  choice models :  choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature  draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the  common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic  elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options  based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice  remains .  these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very  easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models  that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological  models .  the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with  these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how  consumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will  be  to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between  customers  and companies on the internet .  optimization :  traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a  certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue  still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term  profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well

"Subject: re : storage model : simple issues  brad ,  here are my thoughts on your concerns .  * you needs curve inputs . this is an it job . i can help you for the curves  before the system is properly set up .  * intrinsic value vs time value :  the intrinsic value depends on how you allocate the volumes . if you have a  rough idea about the allocation as  you did in the spreadsheet , we can calucate the intrinsic value within the  model . the difference between the  total and the intrinsic will be the ( option ) time value . however , by  pre - allocating volumes , you killed some options .  in the storage model , volumes are allocated dynamically , therefore it is  hard to distinguish the intrinsic vs . time value .  * factor of loading : factor of loadings are used to give historical  correlation matrix . the three factors correspond to  paralle shift , slopping and curveture . the covariance matrix in the model  is expressed in the form  covar = row ( vol _ { i } ) * ( correl ( i , j ) ) * colum ( vol _ { j } ) where vols are  the implied volatilities from the vol curve .  ( correl ( i , j ) ) = l * l ' + residue ( small )  where l is the factor of loading matrix . so in a simple words , the factor of  loadings ( say , 60 x 3 ) are a simplier way for us to  remember the historical correlation matrix ( say , 60 x 60 ) .  let me know if i can offer further help .  zimin  brad horn 02 / 15 / 2000 07 : 15 am  to : zimin lu / hou / ect @ ect  cc : sandra henderson / hou / ect @ ect  subject : storage model : simple issues  zimin :  thanks for your time with the revised storage valuation . your right to  point out the similarity to market bids . here are some basic questions tied  to implementation and calibration :  model infrastructure / it support : i obviously need to re - build my link to the  forward curves as the model is not working in my new location . short - term  ( aprox 1 month ) , i ' d like to establish a link to the ena database egsprod 32  in order to fetch the long - dated price and volatility curves . my link to ena  forward curves would then be quickly severed in favor of the curves generated  by the new bridgeline entity ( database name and data structure yet to be  defined ) . however , its not clear to me what is required in this two stage  process to support your model . any definition of model input or minimum  support requirements you provide is appreciated . i ' ll then work with sandra  henderson , an enron employee providing our it support , to ensure the model  continues to work regardless any downstream system changes that may take  place as we build and establish our separate trading systems or databases .  meanwhile , is there anything you think you can do to ensure im up and running  quickly ?  sandra : linking excel spreadsheets to bridgeline forward curves will be key  to all our pricing projects , not just the storage model supplied by research .  intrinsic vs extrinsic value : it would be helpful to decompose the model ' s  calculated storage price and to distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic ( time or  option ) value . i could easily link a new spreadsheet tab to your model  inputs and to calculate the intrinsic value , and then through a simple  difference i could determine the extrinsic value . ive included a simple  spreadsheet calculation for the intrinsic value for review . i wanted to  share this with you to ask the following :  does the nature of the model define intrinsic and extrinsic value differently  than the simple difference proposed ?  do you think it would make sense to do the simple value decomposition in the  backcode c - code via . dll in order to ensure run - time is faster ?  my goal here is straightforward : a ) to better understand the model and its  sensitivities . ; and b ) to determine if and when the option approach is  associating significant value above and beyond the simple present value of  the time spreads .  factor loadings : what are some of the thoughts or insights you can offer with  regards to factor loadings and how i should interpret the graph of the 3  factors calculated ? factor loadings have always been a mystery to me . for  example , what problems should i be looking for as a warning against  mispricing ? what , if anything , is implied about 1 day price change or  expected curve re - shapings ( after all , curve - reshapings are key to storage  valuation ! ! ! ) ?  calibration : we are preparing a simple summary of descriptive statistics  which should allow me to refine some of the model inputs . i ' ll share the  data when we are and model results once im up and running .",0,subject re  storage model  simple issues  brad   here are my thoughts on your concerns    you needs curve inputs  this is an it job  i can help you for the curves  before the system is properly set up    intrinsic value vs time value   the intrinsic value depends on how you allocate the volumes  if you have a  rough idea about the allocation as  you did in the spreadsheet  we can calucate the intrinsic value within the  model  the difference between the  total and the intrinsic will be the  option  time value  however  by  pre  allocating volumes  you killed some options   in the storage model  volumes are allocated dynamically  therefore it is  hard to distinguish the intrinsic vs  time value    factor of loading  factor of loadings are used to give historical  correlation matrix  the three factors correspond to  paralle shift  slopping and curveture  the covariance matrix in the model  is expressed in the form  covar  row  vol   i     correl  i  j    colum  vol   j   where vols are  the implied volatilities from the vol curve    correl  i  j    l  l   residue  small   where l is the factor of loading matrix  so in a simple words  the factor of  loadings  say   x   are a simplier way for us to  remember the historical correlation matrix  say   x     let me know if i can offer further help   zimin  brad horn         am  to  zimin lu  hou  ect  ect  cc  sandra henderson  hou  ect  ect  subject  storage model  simple issues  zimin   thanks for your time with the revised storage valuation  your right to  point out the similarity to market bids  here are some basic questions tied  to implementation and calibration   model infrastructure  it support  i obviously need to re  build my link to the  forward curves as the model is not working in my new location  short  term   aprox  month   i  d like to establish a link to the ena database egsprod   in order to fetch the long  dated price and volatility curves  my link to ena  forward curves would then be quickly severed in favor of the curves generated  by the new bridgeline entity  database name and data structure yet to be  defined   however  its not clear to me what is required in this two stage  process to support your model  any definition of model input or minimum  support requirements you provide is appreciated  i  ll then work with sandra  henderson  an enron employee providing our it support  to ensure the model  continues to work regardless any downstream system changes that may take  place as we build and establish our separate trading systems or databases   meanwhile  is there anything you think you can do to ensure im up and running  quickly   sandra  linking excel spreadsheets to bridgeline forward curves will be key  to all our pricing projects  not just the storage model supplied by research   intrinsic vs extrinsic value  it would be helpful to decompose the model  s  calculated storage price and to distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic  time or  option  value  i could easily link a new spreadsheet tab to your model  inputs and to calculate the intrinsic value  and then through a simple  difference i could determine the extrinsic value  ive included a simple  spreadsheet calculation for the intrinsic value for review  i wanted to  share this with you to ask the following   does the nature of the model define intrinsic and extrinsic value differently  than the simple difference proposed   do you think it would make sense to do the simple value decomposition in the  backcode c  code via  dll in order to ensure run  time is faster   my goal here is straightforward  a  to better understand the model and its  sensitivities   and b  to determine if and when the option approach is  associating significant value above and beyond the simple present value of  the time spreads   factor loadings  what are some of the thoughts or insights you can offer with  regards to factor loadings and how i should interpret the graph of the   factors calculated  factor loadings have always been a mystery to me  for  example  what problems should i be looking for as a warning against  mispricing  what  if anything  is implied about  day price change or  expected curve re  shapings  after all  curve  reshapings are key to storage  valuation       calibration  we are preparing a simple summary of descriptive statistics  which should allow me to refine some of the model inputs  i  ll share the  data when we are and model results once im up and running

( as of june  19 )  2 ) looking at copper position you calculate a var of - 3 , 100 , 568 with a  total outright of 63 . 765 mt .  this seams too low . if i calculate 63765 x 1807 x 3 . 99 % = 4 . 218 mil . us $ . var  ( outright qty x price levelx risk factor , riskfactr as per mercur ) .  in my view we have been understating var in mercur because we do not  consider the spread position correctly ( i . e . in detail ) . on a position like  that i would expect a figure of around 6 mil us $ .  i guess the issue is in the volatility and in the holding period .  3 ) your correlation matrix for the commodities is not final i assume as  many fields are blank .  lets talk tomorrow on the phone .  attached please find the position summary for the last week # 30 ( since june  19 ) as requested by kirstee .

the way for the  single european marketplace   however  the patchwork auctioning of access to itc leaves important issues  unresolved  the most significant of these include the potential for gaming   third  party transit  and the allocation of auction proceeds  as they stand   these issues  cera believes  are likely to lead to action at the european  level and the eventual imposition of a more integrated scheme   nevertheless  current plans to open most of europe  s itc represent a  watershed of activity that will hasten transparency in the market and  determine trade flows and signal

access  rules and prices will soon work to increase trade  secondary markets for  interconnector capacity will add to the number of actively traded power  products and work to increase the overall

combined with an expected secondary  market for capacity  should bring access to international capacity in line  with the needs of the market  in this way the market will be able to adjust  more rapidly to changes in local conditions and thereby work to correlate  pricing points    increasing competition  once players have secured access to itc at a given  price  they will be looking to sign supply contracts or integrate the  capacity into structured deals  the result could be more aggressive  maneuvering on the part of incumbents and new entrants alike  resulting in  greater competition at the national level    reducing the competitiveness of imports  the results of international  transmission capacity auctions will determine the competitiveness of imported  power into domestic markets  final prices offered for itc will reflect the  relative cost of power between markets and work to make cheaper power more  expensive to import    spurring investment in transmission  the money raised through auction could  provide transmission companies with the financial capability to invest in  upgrading international transmission links  access to international  transmission

expected to  realize a premium for access to highly coveted markets   connecting rather than integrating markets  auctions between national grids  or more accurately commercial grids  are a  pragmatic approach to the problem of granting access to scarce international  transmission capacity on an open and transparent basis  the auctions will  open access to interconnectors and at the same time reward transmission  system operators   even so  the proposed approaches are not likely to satisfy market players or  the stated objectives of european policymakers  in cera  s view the following  issues may eventually bring down the hammer on itc auctions    third  party transit  the bilateral nature of itc auctions perpetrates the  problem of tariff pancaking and discriminates against trade involving transit  through a third grid  this is ultimately inconsistent with the european  commission  s objective of a single european power market  the fact that  physical power flows do not follow contractual flows and almost always  transit third  party grids further weakens the legitimacy of the approach    transaction  based scheme  although still transactional in nature  tied to a  specific deal   auctions fall within the european commission  s stated  preference for market  based mechanisms for allocating international  transmission capacity  it remains to be seen how successful this approach is  in achieving integration of national markets  action at the european level  could move allocation of itc in the direction of nontransactional mechanisms  such as market splitting  counter trading  or redispatching    gaming of auctions  auctions will in theory allocate access to transmission  on a nondiscriminatory market basis to those that value it most  in practice  it remains to be seen if gaming can be avoided  even though most of the  auctions have placed limits on ownership of transmission capacity  tactical  maneuvers could bid up transmission prices as players act to raise the price  of imported power    allocating auction proceeds  one likely outcome of auctions will be the  transfer of profits between players as transmission owners recoup some of the  rents currently reaped by other players  this will works to raise the value  of transmission assets relative to generation  suppliers  or traders  it  remains to be seen how funds from auctions will be allocated

tariffs . i asked him and he said he is not experienced .  i probed too and he does not understand regulatory that well .  does not understand ancillary services ( which is surprising to me since he  started out as an plant operation side of hk power )  has limited people management skills ( he described 1 analyst he works with  that is not capable that he has to jump into the excel spreadsheet and fix it  for him and he cannot give him feedback because it is a utility mentality )  he is not a good communicator ( i asked him to describe what he did in hk  power and it took him forever to explain because he expected me to know that  plant operations meant planning the start up of oil plants ) .  overall :  i suspect that he is a very solid guy when it comes to analysis but not  particularly creative or good at communication and leadership . he would be a  great support person .  i would hire for analysis but not as a potential leader . go",0,subject re  ming sit  vince

would be a good fit withing the group  krisna has offered to hire  him in the research group  he has good programing background and is excited  about working for enron instead of a utility such as pacificcorp  he  expressed interest in applying his skill to make       i suggest bringing him in in research as a first alternative  i see three  potential applications where we can use his skills to evaluate best longer  term fit   continuing ronnie  s model building role  but with a focus within neil  s group  to tie rm systems together  bridge the lack of phd econometrics expertise we have as are result of the  departure of anoush   risk management systems infrastructure development   scott stoness          pm  to  james w lewis  hou  ees  ees  cc  dennis benevides  hou  ees  ees  subject  ming sit  he is no replacement for jay but he could be a dennis b employee   pros   engineer so would be good at math  his boss hired him a  nd time   at txu and again at pacificor again  so he  must be reliable  phd in economics and engineering  good  from stanford  ugh         cons   does not understand tariffs  i asked him and he said he is not experienced   i probed too and he does not understand regulatory that well   does not understand ancillary services  which is surprising to me since he  started out as an plant operation side of hk power   has limited people management skills  he described  analyst he works with  that is not capable that he has to jump into the excel spreadsheet and fix it  for him and he cannot give him feedback because it is a utility mentality   he is not a good communicator  i asked him to describe what he did in hk  power and it took him forever to explain because he expected me to know that  plant operations meant planning the start up of oil plants    overall   i suspect that he is a very solid guy when it comes to analysis but not  particularly creative or good at communication and leadership  he would be a  great support person   i would hire for analysis but not as a potential leader  go

him    shmuel oren  on           pm  to   cc   dennis ray     subject  fw  pserc nuggets related to market stem  hello vince  happy holidays   i wanted to connect with you regarding the possibility of enron joining  pserc  as you might have heard from lance and alex we are going through a  transition period having doubled the number of universities and industry  members within the last year  consequently  our business processes are not  well developed  one of the problems we are facing is the balance between the  electrical engineering folks and industry members that are more interested  in market related research  i hope to recruit more of the later so tat we  have more of a constituency in the advisory board that sees the value of  market related research  i already have a verbal commitment from people at  electrabell that expressed interest in joining pserc  with members like  electrabell and enron we will be able to support more market stem projects  such as the one that shijie deng proposed  not funded in this round   please  let me know if i can do anything to facilitate the decision at enron  i am  going to be in austin on january  to participate at a puct hearing and  could come through huston for a visit  attached are some items that i shared  with our pserc members and thought that you might be interested in them as  well   regards  shmuel        original message       from   shmuel oren   to   power systems engineering research center   sent  tuesday  december       am  subject  re  pserc nuggets related to market stem   the following are  items that demonstrate the impact of pserc research in   the market stem area        on december   i  shmuel oren  testified at a hearing in san  francisco   before the blue ribbon panel  chaired by alfred kahn  for the that is   investigating the implications of uniform price vs  pay as bid auctions in   the california px  as part of my testimony i presented a movie produced  by   tim mount and bob thomas that show results of an experimental economic  study   showing how bidders respond by raising their bids in a pay as bid auction    following is an acknowledgement i received      dear shmuel        thank you for attending the blue ribbon panel this past tuesday in san   francisco  your presentation was very informative and valuable to all the   panel members and other participants  the panel greatly appreciates your   involvement in this important project        thanks again    natalie efland         a recent e  mail from the texas puc     professor oren  i hope you and your family are doing well  we are  seriously   considering your help and advice to facilitate the commission  s final   decision regarding retail competition in ercot      i wanted to let you know that ercot stakeholders filled an application  for   approval of the ercot protocols in november  we received comments  including   list of issues on november  and reply comments on december   staff  will   draft and submit a preliminary order to the commissioners for their   discussion on december   there will be a pre  hearing on december   when   parties will be asked to brief the commission on list of issues by the end   of first week in january  there will be a hearing on january  followed   with another hearing if needed  parties have asked the commission to   finalize its decision by mid march      to give you some more background  i have to mention that almost most of  your   suggestions were accepted and will be reflected in the final protocols    except for problems with intra  zonal gaming regarding congestion  management   and pay  as  bid compensation for selected ancillary services  a few   additional concerns are raised regarding ancillary services and congestion   management  stakeholders are still working toward more load participation   in ercot market  however  the main problem is the fact that market  pilot   that covers   of wholesale  but only   of retail load  will be open on   june    based on a version of the protocols locked on august        that was the deadline for ercot to give a final design to anderson   consulting   that version does not include some of your recommendations  to   address market design flaws  the full version is highly possible to be   implemented by january    when market for   retail competition is   scheduled to open  given this gap  some parties have recommended not to   implement incomplete protocols and wait for full implementation by january     in other words  they say let  s go ahead with   pilot retail load    but wait for full design implementation before allowing   wholesale  load    and retail load  be subject to the rules of the game described in the  final   protocols      thanks      parviz adib  ph  d    director of market oversight division   public utility commission of texas    n  congress avenue   p  o  box    austin  texas      ph  no              the following is a segment from a published summary of the dec  puct   hearing  this segment describes the commision  s deliberation on an agenda   item addressing the possibility of instituting price caps as part of the   ercot protocols   see reference to my involvement in the next to last   paragraph      docket no    petition of the electric reliability council of texas   for approval of the ercot protocols   discussion and possible action    parviz adib  jess totten  keith rogas  and tammy cooper   chairman wood turned to page  item number  of the draft order  identifying   issues  recommending that the word  including  be changed to  other than   in   the parentheses  he thinks they know the ups and downs of the two   mechanisms  which are bid caps and price caps  but would not mind having   parties focus on what other protections might be used  commissioner walsh   would say  including  but not limited to  because she does not think it is  a   bad idea for ercot to at least consider in their protocols a fail  safe   mechanism  it  s kind of like the stock market suspending trading when   something crazy happens  they could consider a maximum scenario  such as    we don  t think this will ever happen but if it does we need to muffle  it     whether it is     or   or whatever it is  they could consider  whether   to put into the protocols a self  enacting price cap  while not expecting  it   to happen  if it did  you don  t have to declare it an emergency and have  the   commission have to act  chairman wood asked if they could leave the   question without the parenthetical at all and just say  what protections   should be added to avoid extreme price spikes   commissioner walsh   reiterated that she wants ercot to think about the unlikely possibility of   unacceptable price spikes  she would like for them to have their own   fail  safe mechanism that is self  initiating as opposed to leaving that to   having someone have to come in and act  commissioner perlman stated that  he   thinks the california  type price caps is what the concern is about  he   thinks everyone in this state is opposed to those  but he thinks the point   commissioner walsh is making is an interesting one  he had not thought   about the circuit breaker idea  and it might have some merit  he agreed   that it was worth considering something like that  then the question   becomes what the level is  chairman wood suggested the wording  what   self  implementing protections should be added to avoid the price spikes    commissioner perlman said he did not think anyone is talking about     price caps  commissioner walsh agreed  but noted that if the unexpected   happens we should be prepared  commissioner perlman indicated that if   someone is making     in one particular hour that it probably does not  b   enefit the market and is probably a windfall to them  it is not something   they would normally put in their business plan for determining whether  they   are going to build a plant in texas  chairman wood stated that they want  to   lean toward the market as heavily as they can on these issues      chairman wood noted that some of these issues date back to when dr  oren  was   assisting the commission  and asked if he could be brought back again    staffer dr  parviz adib said that staff had already talked to dr  oren and   that he is available to assist the commission further  chairman wood  noted   that dr  oren had helped people think outside the box without just  focusing   on california      the final wording was clarified to state  self  implementing mechanisms   and   to delete the parenthetical part of the sentence in question  the order  was   approved as amended

( 2 ) ferc modified the effective period of the november 1 $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap ""  proposal , limiting its application through april 2001 , whereupon a  "" comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which  incorporates appropriate thresholds , screen and mitigation measures "" must be  in place . in a related move , ferc ordered a technical conference early next  year to develop such a program by march 1 , 2001 , so that these measures can  be place by the may 1 , deadline .  in a major modification , ferc revised the refund conditions to clarify that  while certain refund conditions will continue to apply , unless ferc issues  written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under  review , refund potential on a transaction will close after 60 days .  as proposed , however , supply bids in excess of $ 150 will be prohibited from  setting the market - clearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above  $ 150 / mwh will be required to report their bids to ferc on a confidential ,  weekly basis and provide certain cost support .  ( 3 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require the establishment of  independent , non - stakeholder governing board for the iso . the iso governing  board must relinquish their decision - making power and operating control to  the iso management on january 29 , 2001 . a future order will set procedures  for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process .  ( 4 ) in a major modification , ferc adopted a $ 74 / mwh "" price benchmark "" for  assessing prices of five - year energy supply contracts . this benchmark will  be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of  pricing long - term contracts .  to facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable  rates , ferc announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market  participants .  ( 5 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require market participants to  schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day - ahead market and  instituting a penalty charge for under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent  of hourly load requirements ) , in order to discourage over - reliance on the  real - time spot market .  ( 6 ) ferc directed the iso and the three investor - owned utilities to file  generation interconnection standards .  ( 7 ) ferc affirmed the longer - term measures proposed in the november 1 order ,  including submission of a congestion management design proposal by april 2 ,  2001 .  ( 8 ) ferc deferred resolving key issues , including establishing new iso board  selection procedures , developing appropriate market monitoring measures and  negotiating protective orders associated with data collection .  ( 9 ) ferc reiterated its november 1 call to california policy makers there to  resolve state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability  of day ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand  responses ; ( 3 ) siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of  sufficient reserve requirements .  commissioner responses  comm . hebert reluctantly concurred , calling the final order a "" missed  opportunity "" to , among other things , send appropriate signals for new  generation siting and conservation . reiterating his november 1 concerns ,  hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the commission  should and should not have adopted . while expressing pleasure at the tone of  the order ( "" balanced and considerate "" ) , the bid certainly reversal , and the  role reserved for the state in the selection of the new iso board , hebert  nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order , which  he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low . hebert faulted the commission  for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the november 8 order  approving the ca iso ' s emergency $ 250 / mwh "" soft cap "" proposal . hebert ended  by challenging the cpuc to do what it can to encourage utilities there to  forward contract , including easing the existing prudence review requirements .  comm . breathitt endorsed the order , reiterating her support for progress  towards open and competitive markets . she noted that the order properly  "" walked the line "" by taking all of the competing interests into account ,  calling it less than ideal , but a step in the right direction . she also  concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will  be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of  the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint . additionally she mentioned that any price below the  $ 74 / mwh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable .  comm . massey concurred , but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for  california ratepayers , stating that he felt that market power had been  exercised , that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers  had profited too much at the expense of others in the market . he warned  that , as he understood the legal precedents , the federal courts were poised  to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on  to consumers . on the positive side , he approved of the de - federalization of  60 % of the market and the creation of long term contracts . however , he  emphasized that california regulators must now take the responsibility of  creating more generation and transmission . in the long term , comm . massey  hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference  and that the market would have rules more like pjm .  finally , comm . massey articulated what he would have liked to have done  differently . he stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not  enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the  on - going investigation . he also disagreed with the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint ,  preferring instead a hard price per generator . the commissioner said he  would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and  that he would have opened a section 206 investigation in the west . finally ,  he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds .  chairman hoecker began his comments by saying that the commission was forced  to act and act quickly because the stakes are so high . he feels that it is  now time for the state regulators and markets to act . he noted that by  shrinking the cal px , the responsibility is now with the cpuc to fashion the  long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the  least amount of damage to the utilities . in regards to suggestions for a  regional price cap , the chairman stated that this would not work due to the  fact that the commission has no jurisdiction over bonneville , wapa and the  public power producers and that there is no spot market in the northwest .  however , he did urge secretary richardson to convene a conference in order to  address regional issues . finally , in conceptually addressing the california  situation , the chairman stated that competition or "" deregulation "" did not  fail in california , but that there never was competition in california .",0,subject alliance info alert  richardson and

monthly vol curve . the monthly options get marked directly to the  monthly curve ( plus the smile ) and the monthlies get marked to a time blend  of monthly and intra - month vol ( plus the skew ) .  we want to change the valuation ( for the eastern books ) so that the dailies  get marked to the intramonth curve ( which we want to call the daily curve )  and the monthly gets marked to the monthly curved . there will be not vol  blending done by the enpower system for the daily and monthly option  valuations . we want to make this change very soon ( by early next week )  2 . currently there exists one smile for every region , which is specified in  terms of volatility additive for specified dollar difference from the  underlying . since different months in a region can trade in a large range  ( $ 35 - $ 150 ) - this cannot result in accurate skew for all terms . what we  need is a system which has skew per month .  we suggest , for the short term , the skew should apply only to the summer  daily expiration options . we need to make this change by early next week .  however , we need to start modifing the system so that for every region we  can enter a grid which has a percentage scale and specifies the skew  differently for each month . research , has implemented this in our pricing  model , and we would like this grid to be input into the valuation system . i  am enclosing the pricing model ( which we both discussed yesterday ) for  reference . this model is however , work under construction , so pls call alex  huang for clarifications .  3 . the vol input system is complex and confusing .  i would very much be interested in moving to a direct database interface ,  which accomodates the skew inputs per region as in . we should implement a  ui which can input the dailies and monthlies at the moneys and the skew grid  directly - so that we do not need to go through multiple iterations .  i am very much interested in what we currently are releasing in delphi and  would love an early implementation for options .  on all these issues , i am speaking for the east desk . i am going to touch  base with west guys and see if they are on board with these changes .  thanks  harry",0,subject changes in option valuation in enpower                        forwarded by zimin lu  hou  ect on         am                              from  harry arora  enron  enronxgate on         am  to  sanjay gupta  enron  enronxgate  steve nat  enron  enronxgate  cc  zimin lu  hou  ect  ect  subject  changes in option valuation in enpower  sanjay  wanted to confirm the changes to the option valuations in the enpower we  discussed yesterday evening     currently the trader volatility inputs are the daily vol curve and the  intra  monthly vol curve  the monthly options get marked directly to the  monthly curve  plus the smile  and the monthlies get marked to a time blend  of monthly and intra  month vol  plus the skew    we want to change the valuation  for the eastern books  so that the dailies  get marked to the intramonth curve  which we want to call the daily curve   and the monthly gets marked to the monthly curved  there will be not vol  blending done by the enpower system for the daily and monthly option  valuations  we want to make this change very soon  by early next week     currently there exists one smile for every region  which is specified in  terms of volatility additive for specified dollar difference from the  underlying  since different months in a region can trade in a large range          this cannot result in accurate skew for all terms  what we  need is a system which has skew per month   we suggest  for the short term  the skew should apply only to the summer  daily expiration options  we need to make this change by early next week   however  we need to start modifing the system so that for every region we  can enter a grid which has a percentage scale and specifies the skew  differently for each month  research  has implemented this in our pricing  model  and we would like this grid to be input into the valuation system  i  am enclosing the pricing model  which we both discussed yesterday  for  reference  this model is however  work under construction  so pls call alex  huang for clarifications     the vol input system is complex and confusing   i would very much be interested in moving to a direct database interface   which accomodates the skew inputs per region as in  we should implement a  ui which can input the dailies and monthlies at the moneys and the skew grid  directly  so that we do not need to go through multiple iterations   i am very much interested in what we currently are releasing in delphi and  would love an early implementation for options   on all these issues  i am speaking for the east desk  i am going to touch  base with west guys and see if they are on board with these changes   thanks  harry

( enron ' s interests probably lie mainly in the first stem . )  in morning of the first day , researchers from universities  presented their project proposals . i found some of them  quite interesting . for example , shmuel oren , fernando alvarado ,  tim mount ( of cornell ) propose to study "" market redesign : incorporating  the lessons learned from actual experiences for enhancing market  design , "" shijie deng , s . oren et al propose to study "" power asset  valuation model in a market - based and reliability - constrained electric  power system . "" the first got funded but the second did not .  in the same afternoon industry and academic separated to have their  own discussion . i went to the academic discussion and lance the  industry one . i hope my presence there did not make things worse , for  the discussion revealed a lot of organizational chaos and confusion .  the proposal screen process got a lot of heat from participants .  the proposal process goes as follows : researchers first write a short  proposal to appropriate stem committee ( no industry participantion , it seems  to me ) ,  each committee then ranks the proposal and selects the top 3 or 4 . the  selected  proposals are then expanded to be present to the industry . industry then  gets to vote which proposals get funded . however , some researchers were  very unhappy about the initial ranking and selection process . there were  accusation of self - ranking , communication between stem committee and  member schools breaking down , and so on . some were even asking for  some sort of assurance that the project will be funded even before wrting it  ( the arguement was "" then it was a waste of our time to write proposals "" ,  which i found quite amusing ) .  all in all , i found the process was not taken seriously enough by university  researchers . pserc has been established for 5 years now and it still does  not have a proper proposal screen process , which is hard to believe . also ,  the communication among university researchers , between stem committee  and member schools , and most importantly , between researchers and industry ,  are not smooth as all .  since the proposals are voted by 30 or so industry members , the "" right ""  projects may not get funded . too many participants also make the decision  process very indecisive and quite painful to watch ( lance can comment on  this better ) . they also wanted to spread the fund among all schools which  made the voting a less authoritive .  i believe enron will not get much returns from join pserc ( price tag is  $ 40 , 000  per company per year ) . if we find some projects interesting , we can sponsor  the schools in the form of summer interns , the schools claim that most of the  fund  goes to support students anyway .  alex",0,subject pserc denver meeting  vince   the pserc meeting lance and i went to was both interesting  and boring  pserc has  school members and  industry members  its research  program consists of three stems  markets  transmission and distribution   and systems   enron  s interests probably lie mainly in the first stem    in morning of the first day  researchers from universities  presented their project proposals  i found some of them  quite interesting  for example  shmuel oren  fernando alvarado   tim mount  of cornell  propose to study  market redesign  incorporating  the lessons learned from actual experiences for enhancing market  design   shijie deng  s  oren et al propose to study  power asset  valuation model in a market  based and reliability  constrained electric  power system   the first got funded but the second did not   in the same afternoon industry and academic separated to have their  own discussion  i went to the academic discussion and lance the  industry one  i hope my presence there did not make things worse  for  the discussion revealed a lot of organizational chaos and confusion   the proposal screen process got a lot of heat from participants   the proposal process goes as follows  researchers first write a short  proposal to appropriate stem committee  no industry participantion  it seems  to me    each committee then ranks the proposal and selects the top  or   the  selected  proposals are then expanded to be present to the industry  industry then  gets to vote which proposals get funded  however  some researchers were  very unhappy about the initial ranking and selection process  there were  accusation of self  ranking  communication between stem committee and  member schools breaking down  and so on  some were even asking for  some sort of assurance that the project will be funded even before wrting it   the arguement was  then it was a waste of our time to write proposals    which i found quite amusing    all in all  i found the process was not taken seriously enough by university  researchers  pserc has been established for  years now and it still does  not have a proper proposal screen process  which is hard to believe  also   the communication among university researchers  between stem committee  and member schools  and most importantly  between researchers and industry   are not smooth as all   since the proposals are voted by  or so industry members  the  right   projects may not get funded  too many participants also make the decision  process very indecisive and quite painful to watch  lance can comment on  this better   they also wanted to spread the fund among all schools which  made the voting a less authoritive   i believe enron will not get much returns from join pserc  price tag is       per company per year   if we find some projects interesting  we can sponsor  the schools in the form of summer interns  the schools claim that most of the  fund  goes to support students anyway   alex

 - provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market  analyses . the rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with  potential horizontal competitive concerns . in addition , the rule establishes  informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses .  - streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise  competitive concerns ; and  - reduces the industry ' s regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing  requirements .  the rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the federal  register .  commissioner reaction :  comm . hebert expressed reservations that , although he was voting for the  rule , ferc should not be duplicating the department of justice ( doj ) and the  federal trade commission ( ftc ) market concentration analyses and that ferc  should follow the lead of anti - trust enforcement officials , who could also  analyze mergers faster and more confidentially . he also stated that ferc  should review the filings after the doj or the ftc review them , not before ,  and that there should be a definite time frame for review . hebert did  mention that he was pleased that rtos and the disposition of transmission  assets would be exempt , that ancillary services would be considered as a  separate product and that the final rule opens the door for alternative  market analysis .  comm . breathitt supported the final rule , stating that it should expedite the  approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the  fact that older , irrelevant requirements have been dropped . she indicated  that the final rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting  the public interest by stating that the process will be "" efficient yet  sufficient "" . the commissioner said that she was pleased the final rule  addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail  competition and one of her main concerns , confidentiality .  comm . massey fully supported the final rule , emphasizing that it would  improve response time , lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the  industry to better predict commission actions . like commissioner breathitt ,  massey was pleased that the order will allow market modeling analysis that  will better enable ferc to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants  to point to other factors when concentration appears too high . massey also  stated that the new rule includes the ability to address many of ferc ' s  concerns , such as future mergers when they occur in succession , retail  competition , mitigation by the enlargement of markets through rtos and  analysis of ancillary services . in sum , he averred that the order will  provide ferc with the tools it needs for accurate analysis , while taking into  consideration the rapid changes in the industry .  chairman hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was  a very important rule . in response to comm . hebert , chairman hoecker said  that the doj and ftc actually wait for ferc ' s report before issuing their  own , that the anti - trust enforcement agencies rely on ferc ' s expertise when  reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries . there is a major  positive connection between industry consolidation and rtos and that both are  reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work , he noted . because the  rtos enlarge the size of the subject market , he indicated , rtos will help to  preserve competition . therefore , more and larger rtos should allow for more  mergers , he said . the chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that  joining an rto is a requirement for a merger , but that it would certainly be  viewed favorably .  nyiso bid caps extended until ancillary service market shown to be workably  competitive  in a 3 - 1 decision , with comm . hebert dissenting , ferc extended the existing  nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be  "" workably competitive .
